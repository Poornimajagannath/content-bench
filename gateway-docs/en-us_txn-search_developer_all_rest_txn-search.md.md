CARD Platform Connect: Specifications and Conditions for Resellers/Partners {#vpc-partner-reseller-disclaimer}
==============================================================================================================

The following are specifications and conditions that apply to a Reseller/Partner enabling its merchants through Payment Gateway for Platform Connect ("VPC") processing. Failure to meet any of the specifications and conditions below is subject to the liability provisions and indemnification obligations under Reseller/Partner's contract with Relay/Payment Gateway.

1. Before boarding merchants for payment processing on a VPC acquirer's connection, Reseller/Partner and the VPC acquirer must have a contract or other legal agreement that permits Reseller/Partner to enable its merchants to process payments with the acquirer through the dedicated VPC connection and/or traditional connection with such VPC acquirer.
2. Reseller/Partner is responsible for boarding and enabling its merchants in accordance with the terms of the contract or other legal agreement with the relevant VPC acquirer.
3. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that all considerations and fees associated with chargebacks, interchange downgrades, settlement issues, funding delays, and other processing related activities are strictly between Reseller and the relevant VPC acquirer.
4. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that the relevant VPC acquirer is responsible for payment processing issues, including but not limited to, transaction declines by network/issuer, decline rates, and interchange qualification, as may be agreed to or outlined in the contract or other legal agreement between Reseller/Partner and such VPC acquirer.

DISCLAIMER: NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS BY THE CARD PLATFORM CONNECT ACQUIRER IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS. NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR RESELLER/PARTNER BOARDING MERCHANTS OR ENABLING MERCHANT PROCESSING IN VIOLATION OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE RELEVANT CARD PLATFORM CONNECT ACQUIRER.

Introduction {#txn-intro}
=========================

By using the Transaction Search and Details API, you can search for and view the details of any transaction. The response payload for REST is JSON.  
For information about which services can be returned by the Transaction Search and Details APIs, see [Services Returned by the API](/docs/gateway/en-us/txn-search/developer/all/rest/txn-search/txn-applications.md "").

Transaction Search API {#txn-search-intro}
==========================================

Using the Transaction Search API, you can search for your transactions that meet specific criteria.  
To create a transaction search, your client application must send a POST request. The request body contains the details for creating the search, such as the search name, the time zone, and the parameters for the search.

Creating a Transaction Search Request {#txn-search-request}
===========================================================

Follow these steps to create a transaction search request:

1. Send a POST request to `https://&lt;url_prefix&gt;/tss/v2/searches` and include these required fields:

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   * query
   * sort

   Use the name of the server as the `&lt;url_prefix&gt;`:

   * **Production:** `api.example.com`
   * **Production in India:** api.in.example.com
   * **Test:** `apitest.example.com`
2. Include these optional fields:

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   * save
   * name
   * timezone
   * offset
   * sort

For a list of supported time zones, see [Supported Time Zones](/docs/gateway/en-us/txn-search/developer/all/rest/txn-search/time-zones.md "").

Filtering by Query Parameter {#txn-filtering}
=============================================

You can use the supported API fields in the table below as query parameters in the `query` field of the search request.  
Supported operators are `AND` and `OR`.  
Use the format `field:value AND field2:value`.  
Field hierarchy uses the dotted format `object.field` or `object.field.subfield`.  
This list identifies the supported fields and how each filter can be used.

    {#txn-search-filter-paymentType-type_ul_kv2_5bq_r5b}

Filtering Using the submitTimeUtc Field {#txn-search-filter-submitTimeUtc}
==========================================================================

The submitTimeUtc field uses date math expressions and enables you to use dates and times relative to a fixed moment, including the current time, which is represented by `NOW`.  
You can also use UNIX Epoch Time for the start and end time. For example, `submitTimeUtc:[1556712000000 TO 1556757600000]`.  
**Date Math Syntax:** Date math expressions consist of adding some quantity of time in a specified unit, or rounding the current time by a specified unit. Expressions can be joined and are evaluated left to right.  
A slash (`/`) is used to indicate rounding. `NOW/HOUR` represents the beginning of the current hour. If the current time is 4:12 p.m. (`NOW`), then `NOW/HOUR` would be the start of that hour, 4:00 p.m. Valid values in date math are:

* `DAY` or `DAYS`
* `MONTH` or `MONTHS`
* `MINUTE` or `MINUTES`

{#txn-search-filter-submitTimeUtc_ul_xhq_dbl_byb}  
**Date Math Range:** Date math supports date range searches. The syntax is `[startDate TO endDate}`.  
A square bracket (`[`) indicates that the date is included in the range; a curly bracket (`}`) indicates that the date is excluded.  
For example, to search transactions from the previous day, and the current date is May 3, 2019, `[NOW/DAY-1DAY TO NOW/DAY}` would search for transactions with a date between May 2, 2019, 12:00 AM to May 2, 2019, 11:59 PM.  
**More Examples:**

* Last hour: `[NOW/HOUR-1HOUR TO NOW/HOUR}`
* Today: `[NOW/DAY TO NOW/DAY+1DAY}`
* Yesterday: `[NOW/DAY-1DAY TO NOW/DAY}`
* Past 7 days: `[NOW/DAY-7DAYS TO NOW/DAY+1DAY}`
* Month-to-Date: `[NOW/MONTH TO NOW/DAY+1DAY}`
* Past month: `[NOW/MONTH-1MONTH TO NOW/MONTH}`
* Past 6 months: `[NOW/DAY-6MONTHS TO NOW/DAY+1DAY}`
* Past 12 months: `[NOW/DAY-12MONTHS TO NOW/DAY+1DAY]`
* Past 13 months: `[NOW/DAY-13MONTHS TO NOW/DAY+1DAY]`
  {#txn-search-filter-submitTimeUtc_ul_owb_dbl_byb}

Example: Creating a Search Request {#txn-search-example}
========================================================

Search Request

```
POST https://&lt;url_prefix&gt;/tss/v2/searches

{
  "save": "save",
  "name": "Search by Code",
  "timezone": "America/Denver",
  "query": "clientReferenceInformation.code:123456",
  "offset": "0",
  "limit": "100",
  "sort": "submitTimeUtc:desc"
}
```

Retrieving a Saved Transaction Search Request {#txn-search-retrieve}
====================================================================

To retrieve a saved transaction search, your client application must send an HTTPS GET request to the server. The format of the URL is as follows:

```
GET https://&lt;url_prefix&gt;/tss/v2/searches/{searchID}
```

| Value                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
