Local Mode Payment Services {#semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro}
===============================================================

Use this information to process payment services available in the Acceptance Devices app when operated in Local mode.  
These are some Local mode features:

* The point-of-sale (POS) system communicates with the Acceptance Devices app on the terminal over a local Wi-Fi network.

* You can retrieve the Root CA certificate to validate the Acceptance Devices app server's certificate.

* You have the option to activate an mTLS connection in the Acceptance Devices app.

* You have the option to implement hostname validation in your client.
  {#semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro_ul_rts_tjh_bbc}  
  For information about other modes available in the Acceptance Devices app, see:

* [Cloud Mode Payment Services](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/sis-pymnt-svcs-cloud-mode-intro.md "")

* [Standalone Mode Payment Services](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/sis-pymnt-svcs-standalone-mode-intro.md "")
  {#semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro_ul_l5b_yqm_3fc}

Communication Protocol Used in Local Mode {#semi-integrated-ad-app-comm-protocol}
=================================================================================

When using the solution in Local mode, the communication protocol used between the Acceptance Devices app and the point-of-sale (POS) system is a single WebSocket channel. Through this channel, simultaneous, two-way communication occurs between the Acceptance Devices app and the POS system.

Retrieving the Root CA Certificate {#semi-integrated-ad-app-retrieve-rootca-cert-intro}
=======================================================================================

When the app is operating in Local mode, you can validate the Acceptance Devices app server's certificate by adding the Root CA certificate to your trust store. This action is required if you want to use an mTLS connection. For more information, see [Activating a Secure mTLS Connection](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro/sis-activate-mtls-connection-intro.md "").  
You can retrieve the Root CA certificate in the `Business Center` or by using a REST API request.

Retrieve the Root CA Certificate in the `Business Center` {#sis-ad-app-retrieve-rootca-cert-ebc}
================================================================================================

Follow these steps to retrieve the Root CA certificate in the Business Center:

1. In the `Business Center`, go to the left navigation panel and choose Acceptance Devices \&gt; Activation Codes. The Activation Codes page appears.
2. Click Download Root CA Certificate. When the download is complete, the browser window shows a download completion message.
3. In the local folder directory of your computer, navigate to the Download folder to access the Root CA certificate file.

Retrieve the Root CA Certificate Using a REST API Request {#semi-integrated-ad-app-retrieve-rootca-cert-task}
=============================================================================================================

You can use a REST API request to retrieve the Acceptance Devices app server's Root CA certificate when the app is operating in Local mode. You would then add the certificate to your trust store.  
You must authenticate each API request you send to a `Payment Gateway` API by using a REST shared secret key or a REST certificate. For more information about authentication requirements, see the [*Getting Started with REST Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-intro.md "").

}
```

Response to a Successful Request  
The response includes a PEM--encoded certificate chain.

```
{
    "certificateChain": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----Your certificate response data appears here.-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
}
```

Activating a Secure mTLS Connection {#sis-activate-mtls-connection-intro}
=========================================================================

When the app is operating in Local mode, using a Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) connection creates an additional layer of security for communication between the Acceptance Devices app running on your PAX terminal and point-of-sale (POS) system.  
Using the mTLS protocol is recommended because it employs two-way verification. The minimum requirement for providing end-to-end data security is using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  
Before activating an mTLS connection, you must retrieve the Root CA certificate. For more information, see [Retrieving the Root CA Certificate](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro/semi-integrated-ad-app-retrieve-rootca-cert-intro.md "").

Endpoints
---------

The endpoint is the same for the test and production environments.  
**Test:** `POST https://{terminal IP address:port number}/ or wss://{terminal IP address:port number}/`  
**Production:** `POST https://{terminal IP address:port number}/ or wss://{terminal IP address:port number}/`

Generate a POS Connection Code for the Point-of-Sale System {#sis-activate-mtls-pos-setup-code}
===============================================================================================

Before you can sync the terminal with the point-of-sale (POS) system to establish a secure connection, you must activate the terminal. For more information, see [Activating a Terminal in the Acceptance Devices App](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-solution-pax-get-started-intro/semi-integrated-solution-ad-app-activate-terminal-.md ""). To ensure the security of the data sent over the internet between your POS system and the PAX terminal, you must establish a secure connection (sync) between your system and the terminal. You must complete this procedure one time only for each POS system you are using.  
If Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) is enabled, and terminal activation is complete, the Generate Code screen appears during terminal set up.  
Follow these steps to generate a POS connection code for a POS system in the Acceptance Devices app:

1. On the Generate Code screen, tap Generate Code.  
   ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/semi-integrated-solution/images/sis-activating-secure-mtls-connection-1.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)
2. Record the eight-character code that appears on the screen. You will use this code to request a certificate from the POS system. The screen shows an expiration timer for the code, which refreshes every 300 seconds.  
   ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/semi-integrated-solution/images/sis-activating-secure-mtls-connection-2.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Request Certificates for the Point-of-Sale System {#sis-activate-mtls-pos-setup-request-cert}
=============================================================================================

Before you can request certificates, you must generate a set-up code for the POS system. To finish activating the secure mTLS connection, request certificates for the POS system by sending a request to the PAX terminal through the POS system.

1. On the Generate Code screen, tap the Details arrow. The Details section expands to show the HTTP and WSS (WebSocket) addresses and the port number.  
   ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/semi-integrated-solution/images/sis-activating-secure-mtls-connection-3.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)
2. Record the HTTP and WSS addresses and port number shown in the Details section. You will use this information to request a certificate through the POS system, using the HTTPS or WSS address.
3. To request the certificates, send an API request through the POS system to the HTTP or WSS address and port number, along with the POS connection code shown on the terminal and a unique POS ID.
4. After the certificates are retrieved by the POS system and the sync between your POS system and the PAX terminal is complete, the *POS Activation Successful* message appears. Tap Close. The next set-up screen appears.

{
  "posId" : "123",
  "setupCode" : "8QW1YS1D"
}
```

Response to a Successful Request  
The response includes the private key and certificates required to establish the secure Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) connection between the PAX terminal and the POS system. For security reasons, this example does not show actual private key and certificate response data.

```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Your RSA private key response data appears here.
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Your certificate response data appears here.
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Your certificate response data appears here.
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Your certificate response data appears here.
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Implementing Hostname Validation in Local Mode {#sis-local-ad-app-hostname-validate}
====================================================================================

When operating in Local mode, your app can optionally perform hostname validation for enhanced security. When the terminal is activated, a certificate is generated on the device. The certificate includes a Subject Alternative Name (SAN). This SAN appears as a Domain Name System (DNS) entry for the Acceptance Devices app server.  
This is the SAN format:

```
{terminal-serial-number}.pgw.seclib.io
```

To enable hostname validation or connect to the terminal using the SAN instead of its IP address, update your system's `hosts` file to include both the terminal's IP address and its corresponding SAN.

Sale {#semi-integrated-pax-pymnt-svcs-sale-api-intro}
=====================================================

Use this information to process a sale transaction when the app is in Local mode. This type of transaction combines an authorization and a capture into a single transaction.

Stand-Alone Credit {#sis-local-standalone-credit-api-intro}
===========================================================

Use this information to process a stand-alone credit when the app is in Local mode. This type of transaction is used to process a credit without reference to the original transaction. The customer is required to present their card for this type of transaction.

> WARNING
> When processing a stand-alone credit, there is no limit on the credit amount because there is no reference to the original transaction amount. The recommendation is to use a refund transaction whenever possible. For more information, see [Refund](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro/sis-pymnt-svcs-refund-api-intro.md "").

Sale with On-Receipt Tipping {#sis-pymnt-svcs-sale-on-receipt-tip-intro}
========================================================================

Use this information to process a sale with on-receipt tipping when the app is in Local mode. After the original transaction is pre-authorized, the customer writes the tip or total amount on the printed receipt. A follow-on tip adjust request must be sent within 24 hours to capture the transaction. For more information, see [Tip Adjust](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro/sis-pymnt-svcs-sale-on-receipt-tip-intro/sis-pymnt-svcs-tip-adjust-on-receipt-sale-intro.md "").

> WARNING
> By using this feature, you assume the risk of overcaptures being declined and increased chargebacks, so use it only when necessary. Process sales with on-reader tipping, whenever possible. For more information, see [Sale with On-Reader Tipping](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro/sis-local-sale-on-reader-tip-api-intro.md "").

Tip Adjust {#sis-pymnt-svcs-tip-adjust-on-receipt-sale-intro}
=============================================================

Use this information to process a tip adjust when the app is in Local Mode mode. This follow-on transaction is required when processing an on-receipt tipping transaction. The tip adjust request must be sent within 24 hours to capture the transaction.  
After the original transaction is pre-authorized, the customer writes the tip or total amount on the printed receipt. A follow-on tip adjust request is then sent to capture the additional tip amount. This transaction is also referred to as an *overcapture* . For more information, see [Sale with On-Receipt Tipping](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro/sis-pymnt-svcs-sale-on-receipt-tip-intro.md "").

Pre-Authorization {#semi-integrated-pax-pymnt-svcs-pre-auth-api-intro}
======================================================================

Use this information to process a pre-authorization for an initial amount in Local mode. A pre-authorization transaction places a temporary hold on the customer's payment card. The transaction amount can be captured at a later time.  
Most authorizations expire in 5 to 7 days. The issuing bank sets the length of time before expiration. When an authorization expires with the issuing bank, your bank or processor might require you to re-submit an authorization request and include a request for capture in the same message. For more information, see [Capture](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro/semi-integrated-pax-pymnt-svcs-capture-api-intro.md "").

Mail Order or Telephone Order {#sis-local-moto-trxns-intro}
===========================================================

Use this information to process a mail order or telephone order (MOTO) sale and other transactions in Local mode. The payment card is not presented physically at the terminal for a MOTO transaction because it is a card-not-present transaction.  
You can also process these MOTO transactions in Local mode:

Account Verification
:
A MOTO account verification request submits a zero-amount authorization request to validate the payment card.

Pre-authorization
:
A MOTO pre-authorization request places a temporary hold on the customer's payment card, enabling the transaction to be captured at a later time. Most authorizations expire within 5 to 7 days. However, the exact duration is determined by the issuing bank.

    When an authorization expires, your bank, the payment processor, or issuing bank might require you to re-submit the authorization request. In such cases, you might be required to include the capture instructions in the same message to ensure successful processing.

Offline Transactions {#sis-pymnt-svcs-offline-txn-intro}
========================================================

Offline mode is an optional feature that you can use to process offline sale and refund transactions when an internet connection is not available. The device must be operating in Local mode to enable or disable this feature. The default setting is `Disabled`.  
You can enable or disable Offline mode in the Acceptance Devices app, through a REST API request, or in the `Business Center`, where you can also customize settings. For more information, see [Customizing the Acceptance Devices App](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-solution-pax-get-started-intro/sis-ad-app-customize-intro.md "").

> WARNING
> By using this feature, you assume the risk of failed transactions and the possibility of increased fraud and chargebacks. Process transactions offline only when required, such as during an internet outage. Whenever possible, process transactions online instead. For more information, see [Sale](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro/semi-integrated-pax-pymnt-svcs-sale-api-intro.md "").  
> When an internet connect is available, you must submit the offline transactions batch for authorization while the app is in Offline mode. For more information, see [Submit an Offline Transactions Batch for Authorization](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro/sis-pymnt-svcs-offline-txn-intro/sis-pymnt-svcs-offline-txn-batch-auth.md "").

Enable or Disable Offline Mode in the Acceptance Device App {#sis-pymnt-svcs-offline-txn-ad-app}
================================================================================================

IMPORTANT The recommendation is to resume operating in online mode as soon as an internet connection is available. To do so, you must first disable Offline mode.  
Follow these steps to enable or disable Offline mode in the Acceptance Device App:

1. In the Acceptance Devices app, tap Settings.
2. Enter your Acceptance Devices app passcode.
3. Tap Offline Mode.
4. Toggle Enable Offline Mode to ON or OFF.
5. Tap the back navigation arrow to return to the home screen.

Enable or Disable Offline Mode Using a REST API Request {#sis-pymnt-svcs-offline-txn-api-intro}
===============================================================================================

Use this information to enable or disable Offline mode in your POS system by using a REST API request.  
When Offline mode is disabled, the offline transactions batch is automatically submitted for authorization. Make sure that an internet connection is available before disabling Offline mode.

> IMPORTANT The recommendation is to resume operating in online mode as soon as an internet connection is available. To do so, you must first disable Offline mode.

Electronic Benefits Transfer {#sis-pymnt-svcs-local-ebt-intro}
==============================================================

Public assistance programs in the United States use Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) payment cards to issue monthly food and cash benefits to eligible people. EBT cards function like prepaid debit cards that can be used at authorized retailers. Food benefits are issued through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps people with low incomes purchase eligible food items.  
Use this information to process EBT SNAP (food benefits) and EBT Cash transactions when the app is in Local mode.

Custom Card Read {#sis-pymnt-svcs-local-custom-card-card-intro}
===============================================================

Use this information to obtain data from custom cards such as gift cards, loyalty program cards, and employee cards when the app is in Local mode. This service cannot be used to perform payment functions.
IMPORTANT Custom Card Read is supported for non-PCI cards only. To use this service, the card type must be on your allowlist. To add a card type to your allowlist, contact your implementation manager.  
To retrieve the card data, swipe the card's magnetic stripe through the payment device. The custom card read-only function reads and returns the raw card identifier to your app or point-of-sale (POS) system. You can then use the raw data within your app or POS system.  
These are examples of how you might use the Custom Card Read feature:

* **Custom gift card:** Use the card number to check a balance or process a payment in your private gift card network.
* **Employee card:** Use the card number to look up an employee's profile or account.
