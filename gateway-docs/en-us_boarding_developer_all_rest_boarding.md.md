CARD Platform Connect: Specifications and Conditions for Resellers/Partners {#vpc-partner-reseller-disclaimer}
==============================================================================================================

The following are specifications and conditions that apply to a Reseller/Partner enabling its merchants through Payment Gateway for Platform Connect ("VPC") processing. Failure to meet any of the specifications and conditions below is subject to the liability provisions and indemnification obligations under Reseller/Partner's contract with Relay/Payment Gateway.

1. Before boarding merchants for payment processing on a VPC acquirer's connection, Reseller/Partner and the VPC acquirer must have a contract or other legal agreement that permits Reseller/Partner to enable its merchants to process payments with the acquirer through the dedicated VPC connection and/or traditional connection with such VPC acquirer.
2. Reseller/Partner is responsible for boarding and enabling its merchants in accordance with the terms of the contract or other legal agreement with the relevant VPC acquirer.
3. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that all considerations and fees associated with chargebacks, interchange downgrades, settlement issues, funding delays, and other processing related activities are strictly between Reseller and the relevant VPC acquirer.
4. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that the relevant VPC acquirer is responsible for payment processing issues, including but not limited to, transaction declines by network/issuer, decline rates, and interchange qualification, as may be agreed to or outlined in the contract or other legal agreement between Reseller/Partner and such VPC acquirer.

DISCLAIMER: NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS BY THE CARD PLATFORM CONNECT ACQUIRER IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS. NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR RESELLER/PARTNER BOARDING MERCHANTS OR ENABLING MERCHANT PROCESSING IN VIOLATION OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE RELEVANT CARD PLATFORM CONNECT ACQUIRER.

Introduction to the Boarding Registration Service {#boarding-intro-overview}
============================================================================

Boarding Registration streamlines and automates the boarding of merchant accounts using the `Payment Gateway` `REST API`. You can create a simple or complex hierarchy of accounts that represents merchant business units, and configure payment products for those accounts. To understand accounts, organizations, their hierarchy, and status, see these topics:

* [Understanding Accounts and Organizations](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-intro-overview/boarding-intro-organizations.md "")
* [Extending the Hierarchy](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-extend-hierarchy.md "")

Requirements {#boarding-intro-requirements}
===========================================

Before boarding organizations, you must complete these requirements:

* You must have a portfolio account on our platform. Contact your representative to have a portfolio account set up for you.
* Set up users, roles, and permissions. You must have at least one administrator account.

Understanding Accounts and Organizations {#boarding-intro-organizations}
========================================================================

You are assigned a **portfolio** account when you sign up. All merchant accounts are subordinate to the portfolio account. A merchant account consists of a **merchant** organization and its subordinate organizations, which always includes at least one **transacting** organization. You can use **structural** organizations to extend the hierarchy of merchant accounts.

* The **portfolio** account is always the top node in the hierarchy.

* A **merchant** organization represents a business entity. For example, a brand or company. There can only be one merchant in any branch of the hierarchy.

* A **transacting** organization represents an entity that processes payment transactions. For example, a physical store or a payment form on a web page or app. No other organization can be directly subordinate to a transacting organization.

* A **structural** organization represents a conceptual entity that enables you to build an expansive hierarchy between merchant and transacting nodes. For more information on using structural organizations to extend the hierarchy, see [Extending the Hierarchy](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-extend-hierarchy.md "").  
  The image below shows a simple merchant account. The merchant organization is directly beneath the portfolio organization, and contains one transacting organization.

  #### Figure: {#boarding-intro-organizations_fig_cnv_xgj_cfc}

  {#boarding-intro-organizations_ul_e22_mgl_g5b}

Understanding Organization IDs {#boarding-intro-ids}
====================================================

Organizations relate to each other using IDs. Every organization is assigned an organization ID. When an organization has a subordinate, it is assigned a child ID that identifies the subordinate. The subordinate is assigned a parent ID that identifies the parent organization. Organization IDs must be unique, not just within the portfolio or account, but across the system.  
In the illustration below, merchant's ID is `Merchant Account 1`. The merchant's child IDs are `Transacting MID1` and `Transacting MID2`. The merchant's parent ID is `Portfolio`.

#### Figure: {#boarding-intro-ids_fig_ut4_p5f_q5b}

Understanding Organization IDs ![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/platform/bam/boarding/images/create-merchant-account-new-transacting.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
IMPORTANT Do not include sensitive information in the Org ID field. A security validation check is in place to ensure that the unique Org ID field (e.g., Payment Gateway MID) does not contain PAN or other sensitive information to provide an additional layer of protection for your data during the onboarding process.

Configure a Single Merchant {#boarding-intro-workflow-single-mid}

Product Templates {#boarding-intro-template}
============================================

A product template enables and configures a product and is applied to more transacting organizations. Product templates are created in the `Business Center` by an administrator user. Before you board a transacting organization, you must create a product template for each product that you will assign to it. Not every product support templates.  
You will apply product templates to a transacting organization when you create it. You can also create multiple templates for a product, configured differently, and decide which one to apply to a transacting organization, depending on the organization's needs.  
Templates can be modified at any time; however, organizations that already have the template applied do not inherit the modifications. Modifying a template only affects new organizations that you apply to it.  
For product-level boarding information, see the [Product Boarding Template Reference](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/templates-matrix-intro.md "").  
Partners can use various boarding templates to customize merchant onboarding and meet the business needs of each merchant.  
A boarding template is a collection of predefined attributes and rules that an acquirer (bank), technical partner, or merchant uses to board merchants onto their platform. Boarding templates help automate the entire boarding process by packaging all of the required information needed to board merchants. You can use templates to reduce the manual steps and time it takes for merchant accounts to start processing payments.  
Templates also allow an acquirer or partner to make configuration changes to individual and multiple merchants in the portfolio.  
You can use a boarding template to initialize or make changes to any of the following:

* Accounts
* Transacting nodes
* Structural nodes

Template Components {#templates-components}
===========================================

The boarding template combines these essential components:

* **Products and Product Bundles**  
  Partners can offer a list of products and product bundles to merchants. All products and bundles are available in a partner's catalog.
* **Billing Template**  
  A combination of BUY and SELL rates that is associated with a product (or product bundle). A billing template is required for products sold by OBO partners. Non-OBO partners can choose to set a value on billing templates for tracking purposes.
* **Product Configuration Templates**  
  A collection of pre-configured product settings that partners can use for boarding activities. When applied along with a merchant-specific configuration, the product is fully enabled for the merchant.
* **Boarding Workflow**  
  A boarding workflow is a sequence of steps controlled by partner-specific business rules to board merchants.
* **Additional Metadata**  
  These include mandatory, optional, and self-provisioned products, token IDs, and other attributes.

IMPORTANT You can see templates only for enabled products on your account.

Products {#templates-products}
==============================

You can use boarding templates to configure these products in merchant accounts.
* Account Updater
* Card Processing
* Echeck/ACH
* `Fraud Management Essentials`
* Gift Cards
* Payer Authentication
* `Secure Acceptance`
* `Token Management Service`
* Virtual Terminal

Card Processing Templates {#templates-matrix-card}
==================================================

Create a card-processing template for each payment processor you use. Each card-processing template is specific to a single payment processor. Apply the appropriate template when you are boarding new merchants.

Configuring a Card Processing Template {#templates-matrix-card-config}
======================================================================

Follow these steps to configure a template for card processing:

1. In the `Business Center`, go to the left navigation panel and choose Portfolio Management \&gt; Portfolio Tools \&gt; Template Management.
2. Click **Add New Template**.
3. Select **Card Processing** from the drop-down menu.
4. Click **Apply selected product**.
5. Enter a unique name for the new card-processing template, and then click **Next**.
6. Select the type of card processing: Card Present, Card Not Present, or Both.
7. Click the **Processor** field, and then choose the payment processor name.
8. If an Acceptance Type field appears, click the field, and then choose the acceptance type.
9. In the processor tab (labeled with the name of the processor you selected), configure the required and optional fields available for the selected payment processor.
10. In the Common Settings tab, you can configure fields that are common for the merchant but that could potentially be used across multiple payment processors.

Processor-Specific Fields {#templates-matrix-card-fields}
=========================================================

These processor-specific fields are frequently configured in a card-processing template. For more information about these and other fields in the template, see the [*API Field Reference Guide*](https://docs.example.com/en/reference/api-fields.md "").

Accepted Currencies
:
Select all of the currencies that the merchant accepts. The currencies listed in this field depend on the payment processor selected.

    As an example, if you are creating a card-processing template for the TSYS/Vital processor, the list of accepted currencies is as follows:

    * CAD (Canadian Dollar)
    * USD (US Dollar)


    For more information about currency codes, see [*ISO Standard Currency Codes*](https://developer.example.com/library/documentation/sbc/quickref/currencies.pdf "").

Accepted Payment Types
:
Select all of the card types that the merchant accepts. The card types listed in this field depend on the payment processor selected.

    Depending on your payment processor, these are some of the card types you can expect to see listed:

    * Relay
    * Mastercard
    * American Express
    * Diners Club


    For more information about the specific card types that your processor supports, log in to the `Business Center` and go to **Template Management for Card Processing**.

Batch Group
:
The Batch Group groups all of the capture (bill and credit) requests into a batch bound for your payment processor.

    Choose the batch group for processing capture requests.

    The name of a batch group identifies the time of day that capture requests are grouped into a batch and sent to your payment processor. The last two digits of the batch group name identify the hour (in 24-hour time) of the processor cutoff time for that batch group.

    As an example, if you are creating a card processing template for the American Express Direct processor, the list of batch group names you can select includes the following:

    * amexdirect_2 (processor cutoff time is 2:00 a.m. PST daily)
    * amexdirect_17 (processor cutoff time is 5:00 p.m. PST daily)
    * amexdirect_21 (processor cutoff time is 9:00 p.m. PST daily)


    > IMPORTANT Processor cutoff times identified in the batch group names are in Pacific Standard Time (PST).

Merchant ID
:
Enter the merchant's acquirer processing ID assigned by the acquiring bank.
:
Note that it is unlikely that you would specify this field in a card-processing template. Typically, the merchant ID is merchant specific. Also, many merchants have more than one merchant ID to support processing in multiple currencies or to process both card present (in store) transactions and card-not-present (e-commerce) transactions.

Terminal ID
:
Enter the terminal ID assigned by the acquirer or the processor. This value should not be overridden by any other party.
:
Enter the merchant's processing terminal ID assigned by the acquiring bank or payment processor.
:
Note that it is unlikely that you would specify this field in a card-processing template. Typically, the terminal ID is merchant specific. Also, many merchants have more than one terminal ID to support processing in multiple currencies or to process both card-present (in store) transactions and card-not-present (e-commerce) transactions.

Customer Invoicing {#templates-matrix-customer-invoicing}
=========================================================

Customer Invoicing allows merchants to create and manage invoices, send customers links to invoices, securely collect payments for invoices.

Prerequisites
-------------

`Unified Checkout` must be enabled for the merchant. Before `Unified Checkout` can be enabled for a merchant, it must be enabled at the portfolio level.  
When you attempt to enable `Pay by Link` without enabling `Unified Checkout`, the boarding calls will fail with the error `&lt;&gt;`.  
To enable `Unified Checkout` at the portfolio level, talk to your sales representative.  
Customer Invoicing must be enabled at the portfolio level before in can be added to merchant accounts. To enable at Customer Invoicing at the portfolio level, contact your sales representative.

Enabling Customer Invoicing on the Business Center
--------------------------------------------------

Before you can add Customer Invoicing, Unified Checkout must be added to the merchant account. To add Unified Checkout, see: [Unified Checkout](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/templates-matrix-intro/templates-matrix-unified-checkout.md "").

1. Navigate to the Merchant Details Page within Portfolio Management.
2. Click the Add products button.
3. Select Customer Invoicing, and click the Add button.

Customer Invoicing should appear on the Merchant's product list.

Enabling Customer Invoicing with the REST API
---------------------------------------------

To enable `Unified Checkout`:  
Set the productInformation.selectedProducts.payments.customerInvoicing.subscriptionInformation.enabled field to `yes`  
When enabling both Customer Invoicing and `Unified Checkout` at the same time, you can include both products in the same request.

Create Organizations {#boarding-reg-intro}
==========================================

You can create organizations using the API. Instructions for creating organizations are included in these sections:

* [Create a Merchant Organization](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-reg-intro/boarding-reg-create-merch-api.md "")
* [Add a Transacting Organization to a New Merchant Organization](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-reg-intro/boarding-reg-create-new-transacting-api.md "")
* [Add a Transacting Organization to an Existing Organization](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-reg-intro/boarding-reg-create-transacting-api.md "")

{#boarding-reg-intro_ul_rw5_3bq_hvb}  
For API field descriptions, see the [Boarding API Reference Guide](https://developer.example.com/api-reference-assets/index.md?stage=pilot#merchant-boarding_merchant-boarding_create-a-boarding-registration ""). You can test API requests using the reference guide's live console.  
Before beginning, review these topics:

* [Understanding Accounts and Organizations](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-intro-overview/boarding-intro-organizations.md "")
* [Understanding Organization IDs](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-intro-overview/boarding-intro-ids.md "")

If you use the API, keep in mind these considerations:

* The organization registration is done once using the `/registrations` endpoint. Modifications to existing organizations are done using the `/organizations` endpoint. Modifications to the product setups of an organization are done using the `/product-setups` endpoint. Examples of these endpoints are shown in the sections for those operations.
* The boardingFlow field has two values: `ENTERPRISE` and `SMB`. Enterprise creates one organization at a time. SMB (Small Business) creates a combination of one merchant organization and one transacting organization. Enterprise requires two requests, but defines an organization ID for the transacting organization instead of an automatically generated one. Enterprise is recommended. When you create a structural organization, you must set the value of boardingFlow to `ENTERPRISE`.
* The mode field is not currently supported.
* The configurable field must be set to `true` for merchant organizations and `false` for transacting and structural organizations.

Manage Organizations {#boarding-manage-org-intro}
=================================================

This section describes how to manage organizations:

* [Retrieve a List of Organizations](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-manage-org-intro/boarding-retrieve-organizations.md "")
* [Retrieve Organization Details](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-manage-org-intro/boarding-retrieve-an-organization.md "")
* [Update an Organization's Information](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-manage-org-intro/boarding-update-information-api.md "")
* [Change an Organization's Status](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-manage-org-intro/boarding-change-org-status.md "")

Retrieve a List of Organizations {#boarding-retrieve-organizations}
===================================================================

You can send a GET request to retrieve a list of all your organizations. You can use the GET request without parameters to retrieve the full list or use query parameters to limit the results. You can retrieve up to 1000 rows of organizations. To retrieve a list of organizations:

Endpoint {#boarding-retrieve-organizations_d7e717}
--------------------------------------------------

**Production:** `GET ``https://api.example.com``/oms/v1/organizations`{#boarding-retrieve-organizations_d7e724}  
**Test:** `GET ``https://apitest.example.com``/oms/v1/organizations`{#boarding-retrieve-organizations_d7e734}

Using Query Parameters to Filter Results {#boarding-retrieve-organizations-query-parameters}
============================================================================================

When you request the list of organizations for your account, you can use URL-encoded query parameters to narrow the list.

hierarchyQuery
:
See [Using the hierarchyQuery Parameter](#boarding-retrieve-organizations-query-parameters_hierarchyQuery "")

filters
:
Specify API field values using Lucene syntax. Keyword matching is supported. AND is the supported operator. For example, `type:"TRANSACTING" AND businessInformation.country:"US"` will return transacting organizations in the US.

fields
:
This will allow you to limit the response payload. Pass the payload attributes you want and the response will only contain those values:

    ```
      {
          organizationId,
          businessInformation:{
            phoneNumber
          }
      }
    ```

offset
:
The number specified in this parameter excludes that many items from the response. The default is `0`

limit
:
The number specified in this parameter limits how many items to include in the response. When combined with offset, limits the items returned to a specific number of items starting from a specific item. The default is `10`.

sort
:
The order in which you would like your results sorted. For example, `type:desc,entityName:asc`.

Using the hierarchyQuery Parameter {#boarding-retrieve-organizations-query-parameters_hierarchyQuery}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The hierarchy query allows you to query relationships and explore your parents and children. This is a type of graph, so there is a defined language syntax that is flexible enough for you to explore this hierarchy in a natural way. The structure of the query is:  
`organizationId.direction.distance`

* `organizationId` indicates the organizationId.
* `direction` specifies hierarchical relationships. Values can be `descendents` or `ancestors`.
* `distance` indicates levels of hierarchy. You can provide a whole number to specify the number levels of hierarchy to return. You can also use the asterisk `*` to include all levels.

**Examples:**

* `org1.descendents.*` - This will retrieve all descendents.
* `org1.ancestors.*` - This will retrieve all ancestors.
* `revent1234.descendents.1` - This will retrieve all direct children.

Retrieve Organization Details {#boarding-retrieve-an-organization}
==================================================================

You can send a GET request to retrieve the details of an organization. You can use the GET request without parameters to retrieve the full details or use the `fields` query parameter to limit the results. See [Using Query Parameters to Filter Results](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-manage-org-intro/boarding-retrieve-organizations/boarding-retrieve-organizations-query-parameters.md "") for more information about using the `fields` parameter.

Product Enablement and Configuration Using the BRS API {#boarding-products-intro}
=================================================================================

You can enable and configure different products for merchants in the `Business Center` and the Product Enablement and Configuration Service (PECS) API.  
You can use the PECS API to enable, subscribe, and configure products for a merchant. The PECS API is used during merchant onboarding and after merchant onboarding:

* **Merchant onboarding**: PECS is invoked by the Boarding Registration Service (BRS) API.
* **Post-merchant onboarding**: PECS is called to update the merchant's product subscriptions or configurations.
  {#boarding-products-intro_ul_pkv_ptf_lzb}  
  During merchant onboarding, products can be enabled and configured. PECS supports multiple products that can be assigned to a merchant. Some products are available only for enablement and there is no capability to update configurations for these products. Some products are available for both enablement and configuration:

Enablement-only products:
:
* Acceptance Devices
* Card Present Connect
* `Checkout API`
* Customer Invoicing
* Digital Payment Suite
* Installments
* `Pay by Link`
* Receivables Manager
* Recurring Billing
* Reporting
* Tax Calculation
* Transaction Search
* `Unified Checkout`
{#boarding-products-intro_ul_p22_wtf_lzb}

Enablement and configuration products:
:
* Account Updater
* Advanced Billing
* Alternative Payment Methods
* Card Processing
* `Decision Manager`
* eCheck
* `Fraud Management Essentials`
* Gift Cards
* `Payer Authentication`
* `Service Orchestration`
* Payouts
* `Secure Acceptance`
* `Token Management Service`
* Virtual Terminal
{#boarding-products-intro_ul_ewv_wtf_lzb}
{#boarding-products-intro_dl_zfd_44m_lzb}

`Payer Authentication` {#boarding-payer-auth}
=============================================

`Payer Authentication` uses the 3-D Secure protocol in online transactions to verify that payment is coming from the legitimate cardholder. Authenticating the payer before the transaction is authorized benefits the merchant by shifting chargeback liability from the merchant to the card issuer.

Prerequisites {#boarding-payer-auth_pa-prereqs}
-----------------------------------------------

You must meet these requirements to enable and configure `Payer Authentication` for your merchants:

* You must include a merchant website URL. 3-D Secure protocol requires that the website URL must be in the format `https://www.example.com`.
* You must include a merchant category code for your merchant.
* At least one 3-D Secure template must be available. For information on creating product templates, see [Product Templates](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-intro-template.md "").

Status {#boarding-payer-auth_pa-status}
---------------------------------------

When you add Payer Authentication to a merchant account, one of these statuses is assigned:

* Boarded: The Payer Authentication configuration was successfully saved and the merchant can proceed to transact the card network using the specified currency.
* Pending: The Payer Authentication configuration is partially saved or incomplete. Raise a ticket with customer support.
  {#boarding-payer-auth_ul_gn4_xfb_q2c}

Enable `Payer Authentication` {#boarding-payer-auth-enable-intro}
=================================================================

This section shows you how to enable `Payer Authentication`.

Endpoint {#boarding-payer-auth-enable-intro_d7e665}
---------------------------------------------------

**Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/boarding/v1/registrations`{#boarding-payer-auth-enable-intro_d7e672}  
**Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/boarding/v1/registrations`{#boarding-payer-auth-enable-intro_d7e682}

`Token Management Service` {#boarding-tms}
==========================================

The `Token Management Service` (`TMS`) links tokens across service providers, payment types, and channels for sellers, acquirers, and technology partners. `TMS` tokenizes, securely stores, and manages the primary account number (PAN), the payment card expiration date, electronic check details, and customer data. `TMS` also enables merchants to create a network token of a customer's payment card.

> IMPORTANT
> When you board a merchant and enable ` TMS ` and network tokenization, the token requestor ID is enrolled at the merchant account organization level where the token vault is configured. You must include the merchant business information during token requestor ID enrollment and when you create the ` TMS ` token vault. This ensures that the network tokens that are provisioned are assigned to the merchant that owns the tokens.  
> For more information on `TMS` and network tokenization, see [Token Vault Management](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-products-intro/boarding-tms/tms-vault-hierarchy.md "").

Token Vault Management {#tms-vault-hierarchy}
=============================================

Token vaults are where merchants store their customer and payment data. A `Business Center` internal user can enable the `TMS` vault.  
Vaults are assigned to an owner, and all data within the vault belongs to the owner. You can grant permission to individual MIDs to create, retrieve, update, and delete tokens within a vault. Created tokens belong to the owner of the vault, not the creator of the token. If you remove a MID from a vault, it can no longer access any tokens within that vault, including tokens created under that MID.
IMPORTANT It is not currently possible to merge vaults, so ensure that merchants are set up with the correct vault by creating a new vault or granting access to an existing vault.

Token Requestor IDs {#tms-trids}
================================

A token requestor ID (TRID) is a unique identifier that entities such as merchants use to request network tokens from token providers. Having a TRID is a prerequisite for enabling network tokenization.  
Each entity must register with the token provider to get a TRID. Contact a `Payment Gateway` representative to enroll a merchant as a token requestor.

Relay and Mastercard TRIDs
-------------------------

An internal user can enroll a merchant as a CARD or Mastercard token requestor through the `Business Center`.  
Follow these steps to enroll a merchant as a token requestor in the `Business Center`:
1. Navigate to Token Management.

2. Click Vault Management.

3. Use the Vault Owner filter to search for the merchant account that has `TMS` enabled.

4. Choose the merchant account to view the `TMS` vaults that are configured for the merchant.

5. Click Network Tokenization.

6. Click Enroll to CARD/Mastercard token services.

7. Enter the required information for each card type:

   Mastercard
   :
   Business entity name

   Relay
   :
   Merchant name
   :
   Merchant website URL
   :
   Merchant country code

8. Click Onboard with Acquirer ID.

9. Enter the required information:

   Acquirer ID
   :
   Set the value to `40010052242`. It is a static acquirer ID that is used for `TMS`.

   Acquirer Merchant ID
   :
   Enter your organization ID.

10. Click Enroll to Network Token Services to complete enrollment.
    When the enrollment is submitted, the relationship ID and token requestor ID appear on the page for Relay Token Service (VTS) and the token requestor ID appears for Mastercard.  
    In order to request a TRID from the token provider, `Payment Gateway` uses merchant business details already stored. If any of the details are not present, a dialog form should appear prompting you to complete the missing information.

American Express TRIDs
----------------------

Enrollment as a token requestor for American Express is a manual process. Contact your `Payment Gateway` representative to request the TRID for American Express.  
Allow 2 to 3 days for the completion of your request.

> IMPORTANT
> **Service establishment (SE) Numbers** are required in order to process American Express card transactions.

Configure the Token Vault Settings Using the `Business Center` {#tms-vault-settings}

7. Enter the vault name, supported payment methods, supported token types and formats, card number masking format, payment instrument storing configuration, and the webhook URL.  
   For each token type, you can choose from these token formats:

   * 32 Character Hex
   * 22 Digits
   * 19 Digits Luhn Check Passing
   * 16 Digits Luhn Check Passing

   > IMPORTANT Account Updater is incompatible with instrument identifier tokens in the 22-digit format.

8. Click SAVE.

9. To return to the vault management page, click VAULT MANAGEMENT.

Configure the Token Vault Access Using the `Business Center` {#tms-vault-mid-access}
====================================================================================

Follow these steps to configure your merchant token vault access settings:

1. Log in to the `Business Center` test environment or production environment.
   * **Test:** `https://businesscentertest.example.com`
   * **Production:** `https://businesscenter.example.com`

Product Enablement and Configuration Using the PECS API {#boarding-products}
============================================================================

You can enable and configure different products for merchants in the `Business Center` and the Product Enablement and Configuration Service (PECS) API.  
You can use the PECS API to enable, subscribe, and configure products for a merchant. The PECS API is used during merchant onboading and after merchant onboarding:

* **Merchant onboarding**: PECS is invoked by the Boarding Registration Service (BRS) API.
* **Post-merchant onboarding**: PECS is called to update the merchant's product subscriptions or configurations.
  {#boarding-products_ul_pkv_ptf_lzb}  
  During merchant onboarding, products can be enabled and configured. PECS supports multiple products that can be assigned to a merchant. Some products are available only for enablement and there is no capability to update configurations for these products. Some products are available for both enablement and configuration:

Enablement-only products:
:
* Acceptance Devices
* Card Present Connect
* `Checkout API`
* Customer Invoicing
* Digital Payment Suite
* Installments
* `Pay by Link`
* Receivables Manager
* Recurring Billing
* Reporting
* Tax Calculation
* Transaction Search
* `Unified Checkout`
{#boarding-products_ul_p22_wtf_lzb}

Enablement and configuration products:
:
* Account Updater
* Advanced Billing
* Alternative Payment Methods
* Card Processing
* `Decision Manager`
* eCheck
* `Fraud Management Essentials`
* Gift Cards
* `Payer Authentication`
* `Service Orchestration`
* Payouts
* `Secure Acceptance`
* `Token Management Service`
* Virtual Terminal
{#boarding-products_ul_ewv_wtf_lzb}

Add a New Product to an Existing Organization {#boarding-update-product-api}
============================================================================

To add a product, you must subscribe to it, and if there are configurations available, configure it.

Endpoint {#boarding-update-product-api_d7e638}
----------------------------------------------

**Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/products/v1/product-setups`{#boarding-update-product-api_d7e645}  
**Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/products/v1/product-setups`{#boarding-update-product-api_d7e655}

Subscribing to a Product {#boarding-update-product-api_section_r3n_f3r_y5b}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product fields are in the selectedProducts object. Include the field for the product you are adding, and set `subscriptionInformation.enabled` field for that product to `true`  
***Product Features***  
Some products also have a `features` block within the `subscriptionInformation` object that gives you the ability to enable features of a product.

```
"subscriptionInformation": { 
  "enabled": true, 
  "features": { 
    "cardNotPresent": { 
      "enabled": true 
      }, 
    "cardPresent": { 
      "enabled": true 
      } 
```

Configuring a Product {#boarding-update-product-api_section_s3n_f3r_y5b}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some products have a `configurationInformation` object that contains a `templateId` field and a `configurations` object.  
The `templateId` field refers to a product configuration template that is already created in the `Business Center` and is required to configure a product using the Boarding API. If the `templateId` field is not submitted or is left blank, the default template for the account is used. For more information about templates, see [Product Templates](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-intro-templat-0.md "").  
You can override product template values by submitting the `configurations` object.

`Payer Authentication` {#boarding-pecs-payer-auth}
==================================================

`Payer Authentication` uses the 3-D Secure protocol in online transactions to verify that payment is coming from the legitimate cardholder. Authenticating the payer before the transaction is authorized benefits the merchant by shifting chargeback liability from the merchant to the card issuer.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must meet these requirements to enable and configure `Payer Authentication` for your merchants:

* You must include a merchant website URL. 3-D Secure protocol requires that the website URL must be in the format `https://www.example.com`.
* You must include a merchant category code for your merchant.
* At least one 3-D Secure template must be available. For information on creating product templates, see [Product Templates](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-intro-template.md "").

Status
------

When you add Payer Authentication to a merchant account, one of these statuses is assigned:

* Boarded: The Payer Authentication configuration was successfully saved and the merchant can proceed to transact the card network using the specified currency.
* Pending: The Payer Authentication configuration is partially saved or incomplete. Raise a ticket with customer support.

`Token Management Service` {#boarding-pecs-tms}
===============================================

The `Token Management Service` (`TMS`) links tokens across service providers, payment types, and channels for sellers, acquirers, and technology partners. `TMS` tokenizes, securely stores, and manages the primary account number (PAN), the payment card expiration date, electronic check details, and customer data. `TMS` also enables merchants to create a network token of a customer's payment card.

> IMPORTANT
> When you board a merchant and enable ` TMS ` and network tokenization, the token requestor ID is enrolled at the merchant account organization level where the token vault is configured. You must include the merchant business information during token requestor ID enrollment and when you create the ` TMS ` token vault. This ensures that the network tokens that are provisioned are assigned to the merchant that owns the tokens.  
> For more information on `TMS` and network tokenization, see [Token Vault Management](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-products-intro/boarding-tms/tms-vault-hierarchy.md "").

Extending the Hierarchy {#boarding-extend-hierarchy}
====================================================

The Boarding service enables you to build a hierarchy to model your actual business structure or the business structures of your merchants if you are a reseller. You can board a small hierarchy of organizations using only merchant and transacting organizations. You can also use structural organizations to extend the hierarchy. Extending the hierarchy is optional.  
Structural organizations can be placed under merchant organizations to represent things like different types of payment systems, different geographical regions, or any other distinction that your business needs. Transacting organizations are then placed under the structural organizations.

Hierarchy Example {#boarding-extend-hierarchy-diagram}
======================================================

In this diagram of a relatively simple hierarchy, a merchant organization has two structural organizations: one for eCommerce, and one for physical store locations. Transacting organizations are added under the structural organizations. This is an example of using structural organizations to represent card-not-present transactions (online transactions) and card-present transactions (physical store locations). The Stores node has two physical locations that process payments. The eCommerce node has one transacting organization, which represents a payment form on a website.

Reason Codes {#boarding-error-codes}
====================================

These tables list the reason codes and the possible status and reason values that are returned with the response from the Boarding Registration Service (BRS) API and the Product Enablement and Configuration Service (PECS) API. `Payment Gateway` reserves the right to add new reason codes at any time. If your error handler receives a reason code that it does not recognize, it should use the decision field to determine the result.

Product Templates {#boarding-intro-template}
============================================

A product template enables and configures a product and is applied to more transacting organizations. Product templates are created in the `Business Center` by an administrator user. Before you board a transacting organization, you must create a product template for each product that you will assign to it. Not every product support templates.  
You will apply product templates to a transacting organization when you create it. You can also create multiple templates for a product, configured differently, and decide which one to apply to a transacting organization, depending on the organization's needs.  
Templates can be modified at any time; however, organizations that already have the template applied do not inherit the modifications. Modifying a template only affects new organizations that you apply to it.  
For product-level boarding information, see the [Product Boarding Template Reference](/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/templates-matrix-intro.md "").  
Partners can use various boarding templates to customize merchant onboarding and meet the business needs of each merchant.  
A boarding template is a collection of predefined attributes and rules that an acquirer (bank), technical partner, or merchant uses to board merchants onto their platform. Boarding templates help automate the entire boarding process by packaging all of the required information needed to board merchants. You can use templates to reduce the manual steps and time it takes for merchant accounts to start processing payments.  
Templates also allow an acquirer or partner to make configuration changes to individual and multiple merchants in the portfolio.  
You can use a boarding template to initialize or make changes to any of the following:

* Accounts
* Transacting nodes
* Structural nodes
