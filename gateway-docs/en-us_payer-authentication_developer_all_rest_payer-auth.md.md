Introduction to Payer Authentication {#pa2-intro-intro}
=======================================================

`Payment Gateway` has a variety of products to manage and minimize the risk of fraud that merchants face in their daily transactions. While these risk management products can operate independently to address specific areas of risk, the best results are achieved when the entire suite of products works in concert to detect patterns of fraud in a business's online activity.

* Payer Authentication: Uses the `3-D Secure` protocol in online transactions to verify that payment is coming from the actual cardholder. Most transactions can be authenticated without the customer being aware of the process, but higher risk transactions might require an exchange of one-time passwords (OTPs) during authentication. This authentication of the payer before the transaction is authorized benefits the merchant by shifting chargeback liability from the merchant to the card issuer. You can use Decision Manager with payer authentication services so that the risk level of an order determines when to invoke payer authentication. For example, low-risk orders can be set to skip payer authentication and proceed directly to authorization.
* Decision Manager: Uses AI to help large enterprises analyze the vast amount of data from their online transactions to detect known patterns of fraudulent behavior. Each potential transaction can be compared to past patterns and automatically assigned a risk score before authorizing a transaction. Behavior analysis of past transaction data enables you to recommend rules that identify risky transactions and to suggest how to handle them. Machine learning capabilities in Decision Manager enable you to create hypothetical environments to test strategies for dealing with risky scenarios so that you can either reject them or require payer authentication.
* Fraud Management Essentials: helps small-to-medium businesses monitor their online transactions using AI and preconfigured rules to spot and avoid fraudulent transactions. You can adjust the fraud detection settings to match your risk tolerance and manually review transactions flagged for risk review.
* Account Takeover Protection: monitors customer account activity to detect compromised accounts. You create account events and define rules to determine the types and levels of activity in a customer account that trigger a manual review for potential fraud. The activity data that happens within a customer account can be easily integrated into Decision Manager and used to assess risky payment behavior.

{#pa2-intro-intro_ul_l2t_bxn_n1c}  
This guide documents the payer authentication aspect of fraud management and how payer authentication can be used to satisfy the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirement of the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) that applies to the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom. SCA requires banks to perform additional verification when customers make payments to confirm their identity. Access to the documentation for other aspects of the risk management portfolio requires a `Payment Gateway` support license for that product.  
Transactions where the card is not present have a high risk of fraud, so authenticating a payer before processing a transaction greatly reduces the merchant risk for chargebacks. Payer authentication is a way of verifying that a customer making an e-commerce purchase is the owner of the payment card being used. The protocol that is followed to authenticate customers during online transactions is called [EMV 3-D Secure](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa-glossary.md#reference_sjs_jmp_wpb_3-d-secure "").  
This EMV `3-D Secure` protocol is used by all major payment cards to implement payer authentication, but payment companies usually brand it under a different name:

* Relay: Relay Secure
* Mastercard: Mastercard Identity Check
* American Express: American Express SafeKey
* JCB: J/Secure
* Discover/Diners: ProtectBuy
* Elo: Compra Segura (Secure Shopping)
* Cartes Bancaires: FAST'R
* China UnionPay: `3-D Secure`

{#pa2-intro-intro_ul_qf3_zhl_kxb}

  {#pa2-intro-intro_ul_yft_hdj_cfc}

Why Payer Authentication Is Needed {#pa2-intro-3ds-history}
===========================================================

As e-commerce developed, the number of fraudulent transactions also grew, taking advantage of the difficulty authenticating a cardholder during a transaction when the card is not present. To create a standard for secure payment card processing, Europay, Mastercard, and Relay collaborated as EMV. Other card providers wanted input on creating new payment standards, so a consortium called EMVCo was formed to enable equal input from Relay, Mastercard, JCB, China UnionPay, Discover, and American Express.  
EMVCo developed `3-D Secure` as the protocol to provide customer authentication during an online transaction. EMV `3-D Secure` reduced chargebacks to merchants, and when the buyer was authenticated, the issuing bank assumed any liability when a chargeback occurred.  
The same need to reduce fraud prompted Europe to develop a standard called Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to regulate authentication during electronic payments. The use of SCA is mandated by the European Banking Authority in the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) that took effect in 2018 to promote and regulate the technical aspects of financial transactions between merchants and their customers in Europe. SCA requires two-factor authentication. A customer must be able to authenticate by providing two of these three factors:

* Something the customer knows (such as a password, PIN, or challenge questions)
* Something the customer has (such as a phone or hardware token)
* Something the customer is (biometric data, such as fingerprint or face recognition)

{#pa2-intro-3ds-history_ul_ps1_jbd_4xb}  
Although SCA is required for almost all online transactions, some exceptions are allowed. If a payment is considered low risk, you can request an exemption from SCA to bypass authentication of the customer. The issuing bank must approve the exemption before the transaction can be exempted from SCA. Although an exemption from SCA results in a frictionless transaction, liability is not shifted to the issuing bank, and the merchant assumes responsibility for any chargeback that occurs. An exemption from SCA might apply to these types of transactions:

* Payer authentication is unavailable because of a system outage.
* Payment cards used specifically for business-to-business transactions are exempt.
* Payer authentication is performed outside of the authorization workflow.
* Follow-on installment payments of a fixed amount are exempt after the first transaction.
* Follow-on recurring payments of a fixed amount are exempt after the first transaction.
* Fraud levels associated with this type of transaction are considered a low risk.
* Low transaction value does not warrant SCA.
* Merchant-initiated transactions (MITs) are follow-on transactions that are also exempt.
* Stored credentials were authenticated before they were stored, so stored credential transactions are exempt.
* Trusted merchants registered as trusted beneficiaries, are exempt.

{#pa2-intro-3ds-history_ul_qs1_jbd_4xb}  
For additional information about transactions that are exempt from SCA, see the [Payments Developer Guide](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-intro.md "").  
EMV `3-D Secure` meets the SCA mandate for authenticating the customer during e-commerce transactions.

EMV `3-D Secure` 2.0 {#pa2-intro-benefits}
==========================================

To improve the customer experience, a new version of `3-D Secure` was developed. EMV `3-D Secure` 2.x uses a less intrusive process to authenticate a buyer, which provides a better customer experience.  
Enhancements to `3-D Secure` 2.x include:

* More robust device data collection to improve risk analysis by the issuing bank.
* Small screens that pop up on your webpage to avoid full-page redirects.
* SDK version for mobile devices like phones and tablets.
* Streamlined shopping experience.

> {#pa2-intro-benefits_ul_uf4_tz2_kxb} IMPORTANT  
> On September 25, 2024, support for EMV ` 3-D Secure ` 2.1.0 ended. Merchants and their acquirers must support EMV ` 3-D Secure ` 2.2.0 or a later version before that date so that transactions can continue without any interruption in service. Contact support for additional information on updating your system to use EMV ` 3-D Secure ` 2.2.0.

Payer Authentication Customer Workflow {#pa2-intro-workflows}
=============================================================

During authentication for each transaction, data is collected about the customer's device, and the shipping and billing information is compared with transaction history. The workflow in payer authentication can go one of two possible ways: frictionless and challenge (also known as *step-up*).

#### Figure: {#pa2-intro-workflows_fdc}

Payer Authentication Workflow ![Payer Authenticatiion Workflow Diagram](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/risk/payer-authentication/payer-auth/images/how-payer-auth-works-3.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Frictionless Workflow {#pa2-intro-workflows_section_nqp_xv3_mxb}
----------------------------------------------------------------

With frictionless flow, the authentication process is not visible to the customer. The data collected during the transaction matches the data collected from past transactions with the customer. The risk for fraud is calculated to be low enough that further authentication is unnecessary. The transaction can continue to authorization.

1. The customer enters card information at checkout. Information about the device being used by the customer and shopping behavior is collected and relayed from the merchant to the issuing bank. A delay of about 10 seconds is built into the process to ensure that the device data can be transmitted and assessed before the Buy option is enabled.
2. The customer selects Buy.
3. The issuing bank verifies the information it receives against previous transactions. If the device data correlates with the information, the transaction is approved without the buyer having to provide any additional information.
   {#pa2-intro-workflows_ol_wl4_n3f_kxb}

Challenge Workflow
------------------

A challenge flow occurs when the data collected during the transaction does not match the information on file from previous transactions with the customer. This process occurs for multiple reasons and does not necessarily mean that the customer has fraudulent intent. For example, it could occur because the customer got a new device that has not been registered yet or because they bought something while traveling. The issuer of the card decides whether further authentication of the customer is required and if necessary, requests that the customer prove their identity by returning a passcode to the issuer. This sequence describes the interaction from the customer viewpoint.

1. The customer enters card information at checkout. Information about the customer's device is collected and sent from the merchant to the issuing bank.
2. The customer selects Buy.
3. The issuing bank assesses risk by comparing the information it receives to information on file from previous transactions with the customer. If the device data does not match the information collected previously, the issuer requests further authentication.
4. A small window opens on the checkout page where a message from the bank asks if the customer wants to use email or text message to receive a one-time password (OTP) from the bank.
5. The customer chooses how the password is sent.
6. The issuer sends an OTP to the account on file for the customer.
7. A window opens on the checkout page on the customer device prompting the customer to enter the OTP sent by the issuer.
8. The customer enters the password that they received and sends it back to the issuer.
9. If the password entered by the customer matches the password sent by the issuer, the customer is authenticated, and the transaction can proceed to authorization. If the password does not match the password that the bank sent, the customer receives a message that the transaction is declined and that they should attempt another form of payment.

Payer Authentication Merchant Workflow {#pa2-intro-process-overview}
====================================================================

Transaction circumstances might result in differences to the more detailed payer authentication process described below.
1. Before the Buy button is selected at checkout, the Setup service is called. The full card number identifies how to contact the issuing bank. The issuing bank sends an access token and a URL (called the *DCC URL*) to use for the data collected about the device where the transaction is occurring.
2. The merchant collects data about the device and includes billing and shipping information. The merchant posts this data to a hidden 10 pixel x 10 pixel iframe to send to the DDC URL provided by the card issuer for comparision with past transactions. After the data points are collected and sent, the issuing bank confirms that data collection ended and the Buy button is enabled. An 8-10 second delay ensures enough time for data collection.
3. Clicking Buy triggers the Check Enrollment service sending the order data (and session ID) to the issuer. If the bank is not part of an EMV `3-D Secure` program, the payer authentication process stops. If the issuing bank is part of an EMV `3-D Secure` program, the device data is compared to information on file collected at the bank during previous transactions with the cardholder.
   * The issuer's risk analysis software determines whether enough data points collected by the merchant match the data in the bank's files. If the data matches well, no further interaction is needed. This is called*frictionless flow* because no challenge to the buyer is necessary. The response returned to the merchant includes a payload with values like the *ECI* , *CAVV* , *DS Transaction Id* , and the *PARes Status*. These values must be passed on during the request for authorization. It is important to note that while frictionless flow can occur because the payer is authenticated, it can also occur for other reasons. For example, the issuing bank does not participate in payer authentication. Therefore, response values must be verified to determine why no step-up is needed.
   * If a significant discrepancy occurs between the transaction data and the data on file with the bank, the bank requests that the payer authenticate. This is a friction workflow and is called a *step up* or *challenge* . The response from the bank contains the same values returned for a frictionless workflow but also includes additional values like the *Access Control Server (ACS) URL* , the *PAReq* payload, a *Pares Status* = C, a *Step Up URL* , a new *JWT* , and a *Transaction Id*.
     {#pa2-intro-process-overview_ul_wm1_ftk_kxb}
4. The JWT and the step up URL received in the check enrollment response are returned to the customer. Using the step up URL with the JWT as a POST parameter, a challenge screen opens in a viewable iframe on the buyer's device so that the cardholder can view and respond to the bank challenge. The challenge consists of the bank sending a pass code that the customer returns to the bank. The challenge asks how the customer wants to receive a pass code, by text or email. After the customer chooses, they receive a pass code that they must enter into the challenge screen.
5. After the cardholder enters and sends the passcode, the response is sent to the merchant's return URL contained in the JWT. This response causes the merchant to make a validation call to the bank to obtain the final authentication outcome. The response to this validation request contains the final authentication results including these values: *ECI* , *CAVV* (if successful), *DSTransactionId* , *ThreeDSVersion* , and PARes Status (`Y` or `A` = successful or `N`, `U`, `R` = failed, unavailable, or rejected).
6. The next action depends on the outcome:
   * Successful: proceed to authorization, and append the EMV `3-D Secure` data points to the authorization message.
   * Failed, unavailable, or rejected: display a message to prompt the customer to try payment with a different card.
     {#pa2-intro-process-overview_concept_gnm_xym_qqb_ul_nfq_5tx_rqb}
     {#pa2-intro-process-overview_concept_gnm_xym_qqb_ol_btr_zym_qqb}

Acquirer Information {#pa2-intro-acquirer-info}
===============================================

To properly configure payer authentication, `Payment Gateway` uses three items of informationthat your acquiring bank uses to manage payments for your account. If you do not know this information, contact your acquiring bank`Payment Gateway`.

* Acquiring *Merchant ID* (MID): This unique identifier for your business account is assigned by your acquiring bank or payment processor. A MID consists of 8-24 alpha-numeric characters. The MID can be different than the business deposit identifier used in settlements.
* Acquiring *Bank Identification Number* (BIN): This unique number is assigned to the acquiring bank by a payment card network to identify that bank when settling transactions. Each payment card assigns its own BIN for an acquiring bank, and the BINs have their own unique characteristics. For example, all Relay BINs start with a 4, Mastercard BINs start with a 2 or 5, and Discover BINs start with a 3 or 6.
* Merchant Category Code (MCC): This four-digit numeric value is assigned by the acquirer to the merchant to classify the merchandise or services provided by the business. The MCC indicates the kind of business transaction that the merchant processes.
  {#pa2-intro-acquirer-info_ul_p34_1w3_4yb}

Enable Merchant Account for EMV `3-D Secure` {#pa2-intro-account-setup}
=======================================================================

Partners and merchants use the `Business Center` to go online and view transaction activity and to generate reports about their transactions. For each partner, an account is created, and a portfolio merchant ID (MID) is assigned. For each of the merchants within the partner's portfolio, an account is also created and assigned a merchant ID (MID). Access to the various functions in the `Business Center` is managed by the partner through the MID.  
When the MID account is created, the various services that the merchant needs must be enabled. For more information about configuring your account in the `Business Center` for payer authentication and other services, see the [Merchant User Boarding Guide](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/user/all/ebc/boarding-user/boarding-products/boarding-payer-auth.md ""). Payer authentication is a service that might need to be turned on by support. To set up an account for payer authentication, you need this information:

* MID.
* Merchant website URL.
* Two-character ISO code for your country.
* Merchant category code.
* EMV `3-D Secure` requestor ID (optional).
* EMV `3-D Secure` requestor name (optional).
* Name of merchant's bank.
* Name, address, and email address of bank contact.

{#pa2-intro-account-setup_ul_jzp_krr_kxb}  
For each payment card that you accept, your acquirer must provide this information:

* Eight-digit BIN number.
* Merchant ID assigned by your acquirer.
* List of all of the currencies that you can process.
  {#pa2-intro-account-setup_ul_pxq_hsr_kxb}

Payer Authentication Configuration Testing {#pa2-intro-testing}
===============================================================

After the payer authentication functionality is enabled for your account and you have installed and configured the software, you must run tests to ensure that payer authentication is working properly. You must ensure that the proper data is being collected and sent to the issuer and that the proper status for a particular circumstance is returned. To ensure that the proper statuses are returned under all possible circumstances, extensive testing is required before you go live with payer authentication.  
A sandbox testing environment is provided to resolve any bugs in your system. In this testing environment, you can simulate various transaction scenarios with the types of payment cards that you accept. Test card numbers for the various types of payment cards are provided so that you can run transaction simulations. You can verify that the values generated during the simulations are the correct values that should occur during that transaction scenario.  
When your test results are correct, contact customer support and request to go live. When you go live, you will use the production host name to process transactions instead of the test host name that you used when processing transactions in the test environment.  
The host name for the testing environment:  
`POST ``https://apitest.example.com`  
The host name for the production environment:  
`POST ``https://api.example.com`  
Details about testing your payer authentication configuration are available in the [Testing Payer Authentication Services](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa-testing-intro.md "") section.

Request Endpoints {#pa2-intro-endpoints}
========================================

When posting a request for payer authentication, you must add an endpoint to each hostname, whether you are using the test environment or the production environment. These endpoints are used with payer authentication.  
`/risk/v1/authentications`: use when verifying that a card is enrolled in a card authentication program or requesting authentication from the issuer.  
`/risk/v1/authentication-results`: use when retrieving and validating authentication results from the issuer so that the merchant can process the payment.  
`/pts/v2/payments`: use when bundling multiple payments together.  
For example, a test request might look like this:  
`POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/risk/v1/authentications`

Payer Authentication Integrations {#pa2-intro-integration}
==========================================================

Payer authentication was designed to authenticate buyers during online transactions. During the early growth of internet transactions, e-commerce was conducted only on computers. Mobile phones had limited capabilities. When mobile phones (and tablets) could access the internet, online transactions quickly grew, and now they comprise almost half of all e-commerce transactions. A key part of updating the EMV `3-D Secure` protocol from 1.0 to 2.0 was to ensure that payer authentication became available for e-commerce done on mobile devices.  
Two types of payer authentication integration are available for merchants:

* API for browser authentication from a computer.
* SDK for authentication from mobile devices (available for Android and iOS). Contact support to obtain the SDK.

{#pa2-intro-integration_ul_tt2_fjy_kxb} IMPORTANT
Payer Authentication supports message-level encryption. For more information, see [Message Level Encryption](https://developer.relay.com/pages/encryption_guide "").  
Merchants should integrate payer authentication for online shopping on both types of devices. The next sections in this guide describe how to integrate payer authentication into those shopping experiences.

Implementing Direct API for Payer Authentication {#concept_hdl_g1x_wpb}
=======================================================================

The Direct API integrates EMV `3-D Secure` 2.x into your business's website. This integration uses an iframe to complete the device profiling and EMV `3-D Secure` authentication requirements without including third-party JavaScript directly on your site.  
This implementation requires the use of JavaScript to leverage the authentication. The JavaScript is hosted and contained inside the iframe and does not directly access your web page.

> IMPORTANT
> Payer Authentication uses Cardinal Centinel as the technology platform to manage all EMV ` 3-D Secure ` authentication processes. Any references to Cardinal in this document refer to the underlying services that are provided by Cardinal technology.
> A website that provides a demo tool to help users understand how payer authentication works is available:  
> [https://developer.example.com/demo/index.html](https://developer.example.com/demo/index.md "").  
> You can complete the steps required to implement payer authentication on their website and examine the code underlying the process. Use test card numbers to walk through the process and enter `123` as the security code.

Prerequisites {#concept_q1d_j1x_wpb}
====================================

Notify your account representative that you want to implement payer authentication (3-D Secure) using the Direct API integration. Provide the merchant ID that you will use for testing. For more information, see [Required Merchant Information](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-intro-intro/pa2-intro-process-overview.md "").  
Before you can implement payer authentication services, your business team must contact your acquirer and `Payment Gateway` to establish the service. Your software development team should become familiar with the API fields and technical details of this service.

After Implementation and Before Go Live {#concept_nzg_z3x_wpb}
==============================================================

Use the test cases to test your preliminary code and make appropriate changes. See [Testing Payer Authentication](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa-testing-intro.md ""). Testing ensures that your account is configured for production and that your transactions are processed quickly and correctly.

Step 1: Setup Service {#pa2-ccdc-setup-intro}
=============================================

Request the Setup service before selecting the button to submit payment. Request the Setup service separately without including other services. The Setup service response will include a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains credentials to create a secure channel with you. The Setup response also includes a reference ID to use during the authentication and a URL to use when transferring the device data that is collected in the next step.  
IMPORTANT The Setup service is used only in the Direct API integration. The SDK integration does not use this step.  
Run the Setup service as soon as the customer enters their card number to avoid any delay in the customer experience. The next step in the process, device data collection, cannot start until the Setup response is received because the response has the URL where the device data will be sent.

Best Practices
--------------

This practice should be followed so that this step achieves optimal performance and to minimize potential operating issues.  
After the customer credit card is entered, immediately begin device data collection.

Endpoint
--------

**Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/risk/v1/authentication-setups`  
**Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/risk/v1/authentication-setups`

Request Fields {#pa-ccdc-setup-service-request-fields}
======================================================

When requesting the Setup service, you must send the customer's payment information. This can be either the actual encrypted card information or a token associated with the payment data.  
These fields are required:
* paymentInformation.card.expirationMonth

* paymentInformation.card.expirationYear

* paymentInformation.card.number

* paymentInformation.card.type
  {#pa-ccdc-setup-service-request-fields_ul_q2m_xjk_nhc}  
  Besides the required fields, the request might also include any of these fields:

* paymentInformation.tokenizedCard.number

* paymentInformation.customer.customerId

* tokenInformation.transientToken

{#pa-ccdc-setup-service-request-fields_ul_lhq_5ml_xpb}  
The paymentInformation.card.type field is required when the card type is JCB, Cartes Bancaires, or China UnionPay.

Important Response Fields {#concept_am2_mnl_xpb}
================================================

The response from the issuing bank might include these API fields.

* consumerAuthenticationInformation.accessToken is used in [Step 2: Device Data Collection](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-ddc-intro.md "").
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.deviceDataCollectionUrl is used in [Step 2: Device Data Collection](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-ddc-intro.md "").
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.referenceId is used in [Step 3: Payer Authentication Check Enrollment Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-enroll-intro.md "").

{#concept_am2_mnl_xpb_ul_nxn_lzw_vyb}  
For further details on examples, see [REST Example: Setting Up Data Collection](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-use-cases-intro/pa2-set-up-use-intro/pa2-use-setup-rest-ex.md "")

Step 2: Device Data Collection {#concept_ftg_v4l_xpb}
=====================================================

Device data collection starts on the merchant end after you receive the server-side Setup service response as described in [Step 1: Setup Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-setup-intro.md "") and pass the access token and the device data collection URL to the front end. When device data gets to the data collection URL, a Method URL stipulated in the `3-D Secure` protocal captures the entire card number to identify the issuing bank.  
A hidden 10 x 10 pixel iframe is rendered in the browser, and using the access token, you send the customer device data to the device data collection URL. The device data collection can take up to 10 seconds. If you proceed with the check enrollment service as described in [Step 3: Payer Authentication Check Enrollment Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-enroll-intro.md "") before a response is received, the collection process is short-circuited and an error occurs. Despite the error, as long as you include the data from the eleven browser fields as explained in [Step 3: Payer Authentication Check Enrollment Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-enroll-intro.md ""), you can still proceed with the EMV authentication.  
It is recommended that the device data collection start immediately after you receive the customer card number to ensure that the data collection runs in the background while the customer continues with the checkout process, ensuring a minimum of waiting. When a customer changes to a different card number, begin the Setup and device data collection process again as soon as the new card number is entered.

#### Figure: {#concept_ftg_v4l_xpb_fig_tdp_ldc}

Process Flow for Device Data Collection ![Process Flow diagram for Device Data Collection](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/risk/payer-authentication/payer-auth/images/pa-ddc-3.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Best Practices
--------------

These practices should be followed for this step in order to achieve optimal performance and to minimize potential operating issues.

* After the customer credit card number is entered, immediately begin the device data collection.
* Device data collection must complete before the enrollment check begins.
* While not required, it is highly recommended to pass the values from the 11 browser-based fields in the request. The information from these fields serves as a backup, in case the device data collection does not complete correctly.
* As much billing data as possible (unless restricted by regional mandates) should be supplied to the issuing bank to ensure that the issuer's risk assessment software has the most comprehensive data.
* The billing data such as state and country must be formatted according to ISO 3166-2 format specifications to ensure that the network can properly validate the data.
  {#concept_ftg_v4l_xpb_ul_ex1_dgq_fyb}

Which Device Data is Collected {#pa2-intro-ddc}
===============================================

One of the key components to authenticating a cardholder during an online transaction is to compare information about the device that the customer is currently using to the information in the bank's database about devices the customer used in past transactions. This information is maintained in the acess control server (ACS) at the issuing bank. This device information focuses on the web browser and includes these types of data:

* IP address
* Browser language
* Browser type
* Browser version
* Computer operating system
* System time zone
* Screen dimensions
* Color depth

{#pa2-intro-ddc_ul_yz1_vny_kxb}  
A successful device data collection process that includes the 11 browser fields listed in the check enrollment step increases the chances of a frictionless authentication. See [Step 3: Payer Authentication Check Enrollment Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-enroll-intro.md "") for the list of 11 browser fields. Business rules evaluate whether a transaction is risky enough to require the buyer to authenticate their identity. These business rules are configured in the issuer's risk analysis software that evaluates each transaction.

Building the Iframe {#concept_hd5_gpl_xpb}
==========================================

The iframe has these parameters:

* Form POST Action: The POST goes to the URL that is opened within an iframe. This URL is the value provided by the consumerAuthenticationInformation.deviceDataCollectionUrl response field discussed in [Step 1: Setup Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-setup-intro.md "").
* JWT POST Parameter: Use the value from the consumerAuthenticationInformation.accessToken response field discussed in [Step 1: Setup Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-setup-intro.md "").
  {#concept_hd5_gpl_xpb_ul_grt_jpl_xpb}

Initiating the Device Data Collection Iframe {#reference_mhg_xpl_xpb}
=====================================================================

Initiate a form POST in a hidden 10 x 10 pixel iframe and send it to the device data collection URL (consumerAuthenticationInformation.deviceDataCollectionUrl).  
Place the HTML anywhere inside the `&lt;body&gt;` element of the checkout page. Dynamically replace the value of the form action attribute and JWT POST parameter with the response values discussed in [Step 1: Setup Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-setup-intro.md ""). See this example. **Initiate the Device Data Collection Iframe**

```
&lt;iframe id="cardinal_collection_iframe" name="collectionIframe" height="10" width="10" style="display: none;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;form id="cardinal_collection_form" method="POST" target="collectionIframe" action=https://centinelapistag.cardinalcommerce.com/V1/Cruise/Collect&gt;
  &lt;input id="cardinal_collection_form_input" type="hidden" name="JWT" value="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJSZWZlcmVuY2VJZCI6ImE0NjVlYzU1LTMwNTEtN GYwZC05MGE0LWZjMDNlMGE2MWQxOSIsIlJldHVyblVybCI6Imh0dHA6XC9cL2xvY2FsaG9zdDo4MDgyXC9yZXF1ZX N0LWNhdGNoZXJcL2NhdGNoLXJlcXVlc3QucGhwIiwianRpIjoianRpXzVmMDVkM2VkY2U0MjYzLjc5MjQwNzMzIi wiaWF0IjoxNTk0MjE3NDUzLCJpc3MiOiI1YjIzZjhjMGJmOWUyZjBkMzQ3ZGQ1YmEiLCJPcmdVbml0SWQiOiI1 NWVmM2YwY2Y3MjNhYTQzMWM5OWI0MzgifQ.Yw9cB9Hdrg71GPL40oAC0g3CVKYElNGe0uvN9JAaw2E"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;                         
```

Submitting the Device Data Collection Iframe {#reference_yd1_nql_xpb}
=====================================================================

Add JavaScript to invoke the iframe form POST. Place the JavaScript after the closing `&lt;/body&gt;` element as shown in this example. The JavaScript invokes the iframe form POST automatically when the window loads. You must submit it before requesting the Check Enrollment service. **JavaScript to Invoke the Iframe Form POST**

```
 &lt;script&gt;
window.onload = function() { 
var cardinalCollectionForm = document.querySelector('#cardinal_collection_form'); 
if(cardinalCollectionForm) // form exists 
cardinalCollectionForm.submit();
}
&lt;/script&gt;
```

Receiving the Device Data Collection URL Response {#reference_qmk_jrl_xpb}
==========================================================================

Receiving the response indicates that the device data collection URL completed its processing. The response is an event callback that contains a message with the status of the device data collection process.  
Use the `event.origin` URL that corresponds to your environment:

* Test: `https://centinelapistag.cardinalcommerce.com`
* Production: `https://centinelapi.cardinalcommerce.com`

{#reference_qmk_jrl_xpb_ul_z5j_dsl_xpb}  
Study the example below to understand how to subscribe to the event. Add JavaScript to receive the response from the device data collection iframe. Place the JavaScript after the closing `&lt;/body&gt;` element. **Listen for Device Data Collection Response**

```
window.addEventListener("message", function(event) {
  if (event.origin === https://centinelapistag.cardinalcommerce.com) {
    console.log(event.data);
  }
}, false);        
```

This example shows a response payload from the event. None of the returned data needs to be stored for future use.  
**Event Listener Callback Payload**

```
{
  "MessageType": "profile.completed",
  "Session Id": "f54ea591-51ac-48de-b908-eecf4ff6beff",
  "Status": true
}          
```

Step 3: Payer Authentication Check Enrollment Service {#concept_b5y_3sl_xpb}
============================================================================

Request the Check Enrollment service only after you receive the device data collection response. Checking enrollment before receiving the device data collection response stops the data collection process. Data collection can take up to 10 seconds. The merchant should set a timer that expires after 10 seconds of waiting for a response to the data collection so that the check enrollment service starts even when the device data collection response was not received.  
You must include these 11 browser field values in the check enrollment request. These fields provide the information that that ensures a transaction qualifies as an EMV `3-D Secure` transaction. The information in these fields provides a backup for the occasions when the device data collection fails to complete.

* consumerAuthenticationInformation.deviceChannel
* deviceInformation.httpAcceptContent
* deviceInformation.httpBrowserColorDepth
* deviceInformation.httpBrowserJavaEnabled
* deviceInformation.httpBrowserJavaScriptEnabled
* deviceInformation.httpBrowserLanguage
* deviceInformation.httpBrowserScreenHeight
* deviceInformation.httpBrowserScreenWidth
* deviceInformation.httpBrowserTimeDifference
* deviceInformation.ipAddress
* deviceInformation.userAgentBrowserValue

{#concept_b5y_3sl_xpb_ul_j1l_yy3_2yb}  
With the device data collected, the issuer runs a risk assesment that results in one of these outcomes:

* Frictionless success (low risk)
* Challenge required (moderate risk)
* Frictionless failure or decline (high risk)

{#concept_b5y_3sl_xpb_ul_bvh_v3r_jyb}

Best Practices
--------------

Follow these practices for this step to achieve optimal performance:

* Do not start checking enrollment until the device data collection is complete.
* Notifiy cardholders to contact their bank for instructions if a problem occurs. Information about additional action required of the cardholder should be displayed on the checkout page. Providing instructions to the customer avoids multiple attempts to resubmit the same card.
  {#concept_b5y_3sl_xpb_ul_jt5_dkq_fyb}

Endpoint
--------

**Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/risk/v1/authentications`  
**Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/risk/v1/authentications`

Request Fields {#concept_qph_nsl_xpb}
=====================================

The consumerAuthenticationInformation.referenceId field is mapped from the consumerAuthenticationInformation.referenceId field as discussed in [Step 1: Setup Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-setup-intro.md "").  
The consumerAuthenticationInformation.returnUrl value is set to the URL to which the issuing bank redirects the customer as discussed in [Step 4: Step-Up Iframe](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-stepup-frame-intro.md "").  
To request the Check Enrollment service, you must send the encrypted payment data or a token or some other equivalent of card data used by your integration. The request fields can include any of these:

* paymentInformation.card.number
* paymentInformation.fluidData.descriptor
* paymentInformation.fluidData.value
* paymentInformation.customer.customerID
* tokenInformation.transientToken

{#concept_qph_nsl_xpb_ul_efg_y22_gqb}  
These fields are required (merchant ID is in the header):

* buyerInformation.mobilePhone (if no other phone number is available)
* buyerInformation.workPhone (if no other phone number is available)
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.referenceId
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.returnUrl
* deviceInformation.ipAddress
* orderInformation.amountDetails.currency
* orderInformation.amountDetails.totalAmount
* orderInformation.billTo.address1
* orderInformation.billTo.administrativeArea
* orderInformation.billTo.country
* orderInformation.billTo.email
* orderInformation.billTo.firstName
* orderInformation.billTo.lastName
* orderInformation.billTo.phoneNumber (if no other phone number is available)
* orderInformation.billTo.postalCode
* paymentInformation.card.expirationMonth
* paymentInformation.card.expirationYear
* paymentInformation.card.cardType
* paymentInformation.card.number

{#concept_qph_nsl_xpb_ul_efx_s1g_hqb}  
You can send additional request data to reduce your issuer step-up authentication rates. Send all available fields. As a backup, if device data collection fails, include the 11 device information fields listed among the optional fields for the Check Enrollment service in your request. If a failure does occur, adding these device information fields ensures a transaction is not downgraded. If you do not have data for a field, do not send dummy data.  
The size of the step-up iframe discussed in [Step 4: Step-Up Iframe](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-stepup-frame-intro.md "") can vary depending on the EMV `3-D Secure` version of the transaction. You can request the size of the challenge window in the consumerAuthenticationInformation.acsWindowSize request field.  
Requesting a specific window size does not guarantee this size. Parsing the PAReq as described in [Step 4: Step-Up Iframe](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-stepup-frame-intro.md "") determines the actual size.  
For further details on individual API fields, refer to the *[API Field Reference Guide](https://docs.example.com/en/reference/api-fields.md "")*. The field values should use the ISO 3166-2 format.

Interpreting the Check Enrollment Response {#concept_hsh_xnm_xpb}
=================================================================

It is important to check the status values in the response. These possible statuses are the same for all card types.

PENDING_AUTHENTICATION
----------------------

* VERes enrolled = `Y`
* PARes status = `C`

{#concept_hsh_xnm_xpb_ul_pkx_g14_qxb}  
The account number is enrolled in payer authentication. The cardholder is challenged to authenticate. Authenticate the cardholder before authorizing the transaction.

AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESSFUL {#concept_hsh_xnm_xpb_section_qt5_r3x_mxb}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Frictionless authentication was successful/Stepup authentication is not required.**

* VERes enrolled = `Y`
* PARes status = `Y`

{#concept_hsh_xnm_xpb_ul_r2j_h14_qxb}  
The account is enrolled in payer authentication, and the cardholder was successfully authenticated. If enrollment and authorization are made in separate calls, the payer authentication data must be included in the authorization request to receive liability shift protection.

Attempt Stand-in Frictionless Authentication
--------------------------------------------

* VERes enrolled = `Y`
* PARes status = `A`

{#concept_hsh_xnm_xpb_ul_drt_h14_qxb}  
This status indicates that the account is enrolled in payer authentication, but the issuer does not support the program. This is called*stand-in authentication*. If check enrollment and authorization are made in separate calls, the payer authentication data must be included in the authorization request to receive liability shift protection.

Card Not Enrolled
-----------------

* VERes enrolled = `B` or `U`

{#concept_hsh_xnm_xpb_ul_x43_314_qxb}  
This status indicates that the account is not eligible for a payer authentication program, authentication was bypassed, or an error or timeout occurred. If enrollment and authorization are made in separate calls, you can request authorization, but there is no liability shift protection.

Unavailable Frictionless Authentication
---------------------------------------

* VERes enrolled = `Y`
* PARes status = `U`

{#concept_hsh_xnm_xpb_ul_jwy_j14_qxb}  
This status indicates that the account is enrolled in payer authentication, but authentication is currently unavailable. The merchant can attempt to retry authentication or proceed with authorization. If enrollment and authorization are made in separate calls, you can continue and request authorization, but there is no liability shift protection. Without authentication of the customer, the merchant remains liable for any chargeback.

AUTHENTICATION_FAILED
---------------------

Failed Frictionless Authentication
----------------------------------

* VERes enrolled = `Y`
* PARes status = `N`

{#concept_hsh_xnm_xpb_ul_dv1_d14_qxb}  
This status indicates that the account is enrolled in payer authentication but frictionless authentication failed. Merchants cannot submit this transaction for authorization. Instead, ask for another form of payment.

Rejected Frictionless Authentication
------------------------------------

* VERes enrolled = `Y`
* PARes status = `R`

{#concept_hsh_xnm_xpb_ul_xzs_k14_qxb}  
This status indicates that the account is enrolled in payer authentication but frictionless authentication was rejected by the issuing bank without requiring a challenge. Merchants cannot submit this transaction for authorization. Instead, ask for another form of payment. When an AUTHENTICATION_FAILED status occurs, the merchant should display a message from the card issuer to the cardholder using the consumerAuthenticationInformation.cardholderMessage field. The text of the message is provided by the ACS/issuer during a frictionless or decoupled transaction to convey information to the cardholder. An message example might be, "Additional authentication is needed for this transaction, contact (issuer name) at xxx-xxx-xxxx." An example of the entry that would appear in the log for such an occurrence is: "cardholderInfo":"You cannot complete this purchase right now. For help, call CommBank at (111) 555-2222"

Important Response Fields {#concept_gbw_pqm_xpb}
================================================

When you receive a `PENDING_AUTHENTICATION` response, you also receive these fields:

* consumerAuthenticationInformation.stepUpUrl discussed in [Step 4: Step-Up Iframe](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-stepup-frame-intro.md "").
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.accessToken discussed in [Step 4: Step-Up Iframe](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-stepup-frame-intro.md "").

{#concept_gbw_pqm_xpb_ul_ozw_frm_xpb}  
These fields contain values that are used in the Step-Up service, which runs when a customer is challenged to authenticate.

Step 4: Step-Up Iframe {#pa2-ccdc-stepup-frame-intro}
=====================================================

Initiate step-up authentication on the front end after you receive the response as discussed in [Step 3: Payer Authentication Check Enrollment Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-enroll-intro.md ""). Note that frictionless authentication does not require this step-up iframe step. This step is only for step-up authentication when the issuing bank wants to challenge the cardholder.  
When a challenge is needed to prove a customer's identity, a JSON Web Token is returned to you that contains a step-up URL. You open an iframe where the access token to the step-up URL (also known as the endpoint) is posted. The iframe must be sized appropriately to enable the cardholder to complete the challenge. The iframe manages customer interaction with the card-issuing bank's access control server. The bank asks the customer to provide identifying information. Once the customer completes the challenge, the process moves to validating the information that the customer sent.

#### Figure: {#pa2-ccdc-stepup-frame-intro_fp_pzj_ldc}

Process Flow for Step-Up Authentication ![Process Flow Diagram for Step-up Authentication](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/risk/payer-authentication/payer-auth/images/pa-auth-3.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Best Practices
--------------

These practices should be followed for this step to achieve optimal performance and to minimize potential operating issues.

* When a transaction requires a challenge, according to EMVCo protocol, the challenge must be issued within 30 seconds of the Enrollment Check response. When more than 30 seconds elapses, the ACS times out.
  {#pa2-ccdc-stepup-frame-intro_ul_tzy_l2q_fyb}

Building the Iframe Parameters {#concept_s11_vrm_xpb}
=====================================================

The iframe that you display should be sized to enable the customer bank to exchange authentication information between itself and the customer. Because a bank can use various methods to authenticate, the iframe has four size options. The bank will request that you ensure that the iframe size provides room to display the bank logo and the card network being used, the amount of the transaction, and a brief explanation of what the customer needs to do. You manage the size of the challenge window to ensure that the challenge window matches with your presentation screen. You choose the iframe parameters and pass the window size to the issuer.

* Use the JWT POST Parameter value from the consumerAuthenticationInformation.accessToken response field and do a form POST within the iframe to the step up Url value that is passed by the consumerAuthenticationInformation.stepUpUrl response field.
* MD POST Parameter: Merchant-defined data returned in the response. This field is optional.
* Iframe height and width: EMV `3-D Secure` 2.x offers multiple size options:
  * Use the consumerAuthenticationInformation.acsWindowSize request field to request a specific window size.
  * Use the consumerAuthenticationInformation.pareq response field to determine iframe dimensions by Base64 decoding the string and cross-referencing a Challenge Window Size value with its corresponding size.
    {#concept_s11_vrm_xpb_ul_y1h_ssm_xpb}

{#concept_s11_vrm_xpb_ul_bzt_zrm_xpb}  
This table lists the possible values for iframe size and the sizes associated with the value.

| Challenge Window Size Value | Step-Up Iframe Dimensions (Width x Height in pixels) |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| 01                          | 250 x 400                                            |
| 02                          | 390 x 400                                            |
| 03                          | 500 x 600                                            |
| 04                          | 600 x 400                                            |

This is an example for the decoded value.
**Challenge Window Size Decoded Value**

```
{
    "messageType":"CReq","messageVersion":"2.2.0",
    "threeDSServerTransID":"c4b911d6-1f5c-40a4-bc2b-51986a98f991",

    "challengeWindowSize":"02"
}                            
```

Creating the Iframe {#reference_wpq_stm_xpb}
============================================

Create an iframe that is the same size as the Challenge Window Size to send a POST request to the step-up URL. Study this example.  
**Send a POST Request to the Step-Up URL**

```

Invoking the Iframe {#reference_ymr_35m_xpb}
============================================

Add JavaScript to invoke the iframe form POST. Place the JavaScript after the closing `&lt;/body&gt;` tag as shown in the example below. The JavaScript invokes the iframe form POST automatically when the window loads. While you can submit the form at a different time, you must submit the form before requesting the validation service.

```
&lt;script&gt;
window.onload = function() {   
    var stepUpForm = document.querySelector('#step-up-form');
    if(stepUpForm) // Step-Up form exists
    stepUpForm.submit();
}
&lt;/script&gt;                           
```

Receiving the Step-Up Results {#concept_nng_lvm_xpb}
====================================================

After the customer interacts with the issuing bank, the customer is returned to the consumerAuthenticationInformation.returnUrl within the iframe as specified in [Step 3: Payer Authentication Check Enrollment Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-enroll-intro.md ""). Since you host the return URL, you can then close the iframe after redirection.  
The response sent back to the return URL contains these values:

* Transaction ID: (consumerAuthenticationInformation.authenticationTransactionId response field). This value is used in [Step 5: Payer Authentication Validation Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-validate-intro.md "").
* MD: merchant data returned if present in the POST to step-up URL; otherwise, null.

{#concept_nng_lvm_xpb_ul_k3v_mvm_xpb} **POST to Return URL**

```
TransactionId=BwNsDeDPsQV4q8uy1Kq1&MD=null                            
```

Step 5: Payer Authentication Validation Service {#concept_p5s_cwm_xpb}
======================================================================

When you receive the step-up response as discussed in [Step 4: Step-Up Iframe](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-stepup-frame-intro.md ""), verify that the customer was successfully authenticated. Note that frictionless authentication does not require this validation step. Validation is required only for step-up authentication.

**Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/risk/v1/authentication-results`  
**Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/risk/v1/authentication-results`

Request Fields {#concept_sxk_hwm_xpb}
=====================================

The consumerAuthenticationInformation.authenticationTransactionId field in this step is mapped from the consumerAuthenticationInformation.authenticationTransactionId field in [Step 4: Step-Up Iframe](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-ccdc-stepup-frame-intro.md "").  
These fields are required:

* clientReferenceInformation.code
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.authenticationTransactionId
* orderInformation.amountDetails.currency
* orderInformation.amountDetails.total Amount or orderInformation.lineItems.unitPrice
* paymentInformation.card.expirationMonth
* paymentInformation.card.expirationYear
* paymentInformation.card.number
* paymentInformation.card.type

{#concept_sxk_hwm_xpb_ul_s5p_wnk_tyb}  
For examples, see [Validating a Challenge](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-use-cases-intro/pa2-use-validate-intro.md "").  
For further details on individual API fields, refer to the *[API Field Reference Guide](https://docs.example.com/en/reference/api-fields.md "")*.

Interpreting the Validation Response {#pa2-ccdc-validate-interpreting-response}
===============================================================================

If the authentication is rejected (TransStatus R), Relay, China UnionPay, Elo, JCB, Diners Club, Discover, and American Express recommend not proceeding to authorization. Instead, ask the customer to use another payment method.  
Proceed with the order according to the validation response that you receive. The possible validation response statuses are the same for all of the card types.

AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESSFUL
-------------------------

**Successful Step-Up Authentication**

* PARes status = `Y`

{#pa2-ccdc-validate-interpreting-response_ul_qpp_m14_qxb}  
Step-up authentication of the customer was successful. If you request the Validate Authentication and Authorization services separately, you must add the required payer validate payload values to your authorization request before you can receive chargeback protection that shifts the liability to the issuer.  
**Unavailable Step-up Authentication**

* PARes status = `U`

{#pa2-ccdc-validate-interpreting-response_ul_lwx_m14_qxb}  
Step-up authentication was unavailable and the customer could not be authenticated. This status does not necessarily indicate any fraudulent intent from the customer. Merchants can either attempt to retry authentication or continue to authorization. If you are making separate validatation and authorization calls, you can still proceed with the authorization request but there is no liability shift. Without authentication, the merchant remains liable for any chargeback if it should occur with the transaction.

AUTHENTICATION_FAILED
---------------------

**Unavailable Step-up Authentication**
* PARes status = `N`
  {#pa2-ccdc-validate-interpreting-response_ul_e2h_n14_qxb}  
  The customer could not be authenticated. Do not submit this transaction for authorization. Instead ask the customer for another form of payment.  
  **Error**  
  If you receive an error from the payment card company, process the order according to your business rules. If the error occurs frequently, report it to customer supportcustomer supportcustomer support. If you receive a system error, determine the cause of the error and proceed with card authorization only when appropriate.

Redirecting Customers to Pass or Fail Message Page {#concept_tzt_yjx_wpb}
=========================================================================

After authentication is complete, redirect the customer to a page containing a success or failure message. You must ensure that the messages that display to customers are accurate and complete, and that the message addresses all possible scenarios for enrolled and non-enrolled cards. For example, if the authentication fails, display a message such as this to the customer:

```
Authentication Failed
Your card issuer cannot authenticate this card. Please select another card or form of payment to complete your purchase.
```

Combining the Authentication and the Authorization Services {#concept_zz1_s5l_xpb}
==================================================================================

After the customer is successfully authenticated, you must get authorization from the issuing bank to proceed with the transaction. While these are separate processes, it is recommended that you link these services by immediately passing the returned values into a request to authorize the transaction. The two services can be linked when:

* Checking enrollment determines that no challenge is required. Pass the values returned from checking enrollment to the authorization request.
* Validating a challenge authenticates the cardholder. Pass the values returned from validating the challenge to the authorization request.

{#concept_zz1_s5l_xpb_ul_q1p_yw3_4yb}  
With the same request transactions, a different endpoint must be referenced for the authorization, and an additional element must be added to the JSON. When step-up authentication is required, transaction processing stops to allow completion of authentication, and authorization is not called until after the challenge response is validated. This integration method is recommended.  
Depending on your card type, you might not receive the XID value. If you receive this field under a frictionless scenario, it is required for authorization.

Combining Check Enrollment and the Authorization Services {#pa2_ccdc_combining_services_enroll}
===============================================================================================

Receiving certain responses from checking enrollment allows the authorization to be requested immediately afterwards. The possible checking enrollment responses are:

* Successful frictionless authentication
* Attempted stand-in frictionless authentication
* Issuer does not support the payer authentication program
* Account is not eligible for a payer authentication program
* Unavailable frictionless authentication
* Failed frictionless authentication
* Rejected frictionless authentication

{#pa2_ccdc_combining_services_enroll_ul_i1x_w24_pyb}  
In all checking enrollment scenarios, it is recommended that you integrate these services by combining the checking enrollment and authorization services into a single transaction. When the services are combined, one of these conditions occurs:

* No additional integration work is required to manually map the appropriate check enrollment results to the corresponding authorization request fields.
* If further authentication is needed, the authorization cannot happen until after authentication completes and you can proceed to the next steps for challenging.

{#pa2_ccdc_combining_services_enroll_ol_hqh_cf4_pyb}  
With same request transactions, a different endpoint must be referenced for the authorization, and an additional element must be added to the JSON. Depending on your card type, you might not receive the XID value. If you receive this field under a frictionless scenario, it is required for authorization.

Endpoint
--------

**Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/risk/v1/authentications`  
**Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/risk/v1/authentications`

Check Enrollment Response Fields and Their Equivalent Authorization Request Fields {#pa2-ccdc-combining-mapping-check-enroll-auth-fields}
=========================================================================================================================================

When a customer is authenticated without a challenge, the transaction can be authorized either in the same request or in a separate authorization request. Whether authorization occurs in the same request or a separate request, the values from the check enrollment response must be passed to the authorization request to qualify for a liability shift. This table matches the check enrollment fields with their equivalent authorization fields. Sometimes a check enrollment response field is the same field used in the authorization request.  
Be sure to include the following card-specific information in your authorization request:

* For Relay, JCB, China UnionPay, Elo,Diners Club, Discover, and American Express include the *CAVV*.
* For Mastercard only, include the collection indicator and the *AAV* (also known as *UCAF*).

Combining the Validation and the Authorization Services {#pa2-ccdc-combining-services-valid}
============================================================================================

After the customer is successfully authenticated, you must get authorization from the issuing bank to proceed with the transaction. While these are separate processes, you should integrate these two services into a single process whenever possible. When you do so, no additional integration work is required on your part to manually map the appropriate validation results to corresponding authorization request fields.  
With the same request transactions, a different endpoint must be referenced for the authorization, and an additional element must be added to the JSON. When step-up authentication is required, transaction processing stops to allow authentication to complete, and authorization is not called until after the challenge response is validated. This integration method is highly recommended. Depending on your card type, you might not receive the XID value. If you receive this field under a frictionless scenario, it is required for authorization.

**Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/pts/v2/payments`  
**Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/pts/v2/payments`

Validation Fields and their Equivalent Authorization Fields {#pa2-ccdc-combining-map-validate-auth-fields}
==========================================================================================================

When a customer is authenticated after a challenge, the transaction can be authorized in the same request or in a separate authorization request. Whether authorization is combined with validation or occurs in a separate request, the values from the validation response must be passed to the authorization request to qualify for a liability shift to the issuing bank. This table pairs the Validation field with its equivalent Authorization API field.  
Be sure to include the following card-specific information in your authorization request:

* For Relay, JCB, China UnionPay, Elo, Diners Club, Discover, and American Express include the CAVV.
* For Mastercard only, include the collection indicator and the AAV (also known as UCAF).

Implementing SDK Payer Authentication {#concept_ycl_lny_wpb}
============================================================

This chapter summarizes the process of integrating SDK Payer Authentication services into your mobile application. Payer authentication services use the Mobile SDK for iOS or Android to facilitate the authentication. New SDK versions are frequently released and you should ensure that you stay current with the latest release. One way to stay informed on about new releases is to subscribe to a distribution list to be informed of updates and other product announcements. You can subscribe by going to this link: [Cardinal SDK Notifications](https://win.cardinalcommerce.com/CardinalMobileSDKNotifications "").  
Implementing the SDK in your mobile application requires either Android or iOS platform application programming skills. Android API 21 or iOS 9 and XCode 8 are required.  
The SDK is only designed to handle EMV `3-D Secure` 2.x transactions.

Implementation Overview {#concept_knf_xny_wpb}
==============================================

Notify your account representative that you want to implement payer authentication (EMV `3-D Secure`). Give the representative the merchant ID that you will use for testing. For more information, see [Payer Authentication Merchant Workflow](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa2-intro-intro/pa2-intro-process-overview.md "").  
IMPORTANT The SDK integration operates in a similar manner to the Direct API integration, but SDK does not have a Setup service step.  
Implementation tasks include:

* Download, import, and configure the Mobile SDK for either iOS or Android.
* For each purchase request:
  * Build the authentication request.
  * Invoke the authentication.
  * Handle declines.
  * Make another back-end, server-to-server call to request these services:  
    : Payer Authentication Validation  
    : Card Authorization service (optional)
    {#concept_knf_xny_wpb_ul_n3m_s1z_wpb}
* Use the test cases to test your preliminary code and make appropriate changes. See [Testing Payer Authentication](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa-testing-intro.md "").
* Ensure that your account is configured for production.

{#concept_knf_xny_wpb_ul_h4z_hqy_wpb}  
Note that calling the Payer Authentication Setup Service is not required with the SDK mobile version.

Process Flow for SDK Integration {#concept_uwx_ncz_wpb}
=======================================================

The steps required to integrate payer authentication into an SDK mobile application are described below.

1. Contact customer support to register for an API key.
2. Download and import the Mobile SDK for either iOS or Android.
3. Set up your build environment.
4. Configure your SDK.
5. Setup the initial request to Cardinal.
6. Create an API request to your merchant server to request the Enrollment Check service, passing in transaction details and the consumerAuthenticationInformation.referenceId request field.
7. If the issuing bank does not require authentication, you receive this information in the Enrollment Check response:
   * E-commerce indicator (consumerAuthenticationInformation.ecommerceIndicator)
   * CAVV (all card types except Mastercard) (consumerAuthenticationInformation.cavv)
   * AAV (Mastercard only) (consumerAuthenticationInformation.ucafCollectionIndicator)
   * Transaction ID (consumerAuthenticationInformation.xid )
   * `3-D Secure` version (consumerAuthenticationInformation.specificationVersion)
   * Directory server transaction ID (consumerAuthenticationInformation.directoryServerTransactionId)
     {#concept_uwx_ncz_wpb_ul_tl4_22z_wpb}
8. If the issuing bank requires authentication, you receive a response with the payload and the transaction ID that you include in the *Cardinal.continue* call from your SDK.
9. The Mobile SDK displays an authentication window, and the customer enters the authentication information into that window.
10. The bank validates the customer credentials and a JSON Web Token (JWT) is returned by the SDK in the onValidated callback that the merchant is required to validate server-side for security reasons.
11. Create an API call to your merchant server to request the Validate Authentication service, extracting the processor transaction ID value from the JWT and sending it in the consumerAuthenticationInformation.authenticationTransactionId request field. You receive the e-commerce indicator, CAVV or AAV, transaction ID, `3-D Secure` version, and directory server transaction ID.

{#concept_uwx_ncz_wpb_ol_xm1_tcz_wpb}  
Verify that the authentication was successful and continue processing your order.  
You must pass all pertinent data for the card type and processor in your authorization request. For more information, see [Requesting the Validation Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa-sdk-intro/pa-sdk-implementing-sdk-pa/pa-sdk-implementing-request-validation.md "").

Prerequisites for SDK Implementation {#concept_y4k_qbz_wpb}
===========================================================

Before you can implement payer authentication services, your business team must contact your acquirer and `Payment Gateway` to establish the service. Your software development team should become familiar with the API fields and technical details of this service.  
Creating a mobile application with the SDK implementation, requires that you perform some preliminary procedures before the starting the actual payer authentication implementation process. These processes involving JWTs are described in this section.

Credentials/API Keys {#concept_ql2_wwk_bqb}
===========================================

API keys are required to create the JSON Web Token (JWT). For further information, contact [customer support](http://support.example.com "") .  
You will receive an email with your username and a temporary password. Your username will be in this format:  
`payment-gateway_merchant name_contact name`  
For example:  
`payment-gateway_petairways_peter`  
Once you receive your credentials, log in to your JFrog account and update your temporary password. Follow the process below to generate your API key.

Generating your API Key: {#task_m22_5hl_2qb}
============================================

1. Log in to your JFrog account.
2. In the top-right of the JFrog Platform, select the Welcome drop-down menu and click Edit Profile.
3. Enter your password and click Unlock.
4. Under Authentication Settings, click Generate API Key.

Mobile Device Data Collected {#concept_mky_31r_tyb}
===================================================

One of the key components to authenticating a cardholder during an online transaction is to compare information about the mobile device that the buyer is using to the information about mobile devices that the buyer used in past transactions. This information is maintained in the access control server (ACS) at the issuing bank.  
In mobile device transactions, information collected about the buyer device can include:

* Device ID
* Device model
* Operating system version
* System language
* Country
* Time zone
* Screen dimensions

{#concept_mky_31r_tyb_ul_hld_5br_tyb}  
A successful device data collection process that includes the eleven browser fields listed in the check enrollment step, increases the chances of a frictionless authentication. The decision to escalate a transaction to a level of risk high enough to require challenging the buyer to authenticate their identity is managed by business rules that are configured in the issuer's risk analysis software that evaluates each transaction.

Using the Android SDK {#concept_efq_v1c_fqb}
============================================

A mobile SDK is available for integrating payer authentication services into mobile applications running on the Android platform.

Updating the Gradle Build Properties {#reference_lrk_l5d_xpb}
=============================================================

In Android Studio, open the app directory (which can also be labeled Module: app) and open the *build.gradle* file. Edit the Gradle file located in the app directory. Add the contents shown in the example below to the Gradle file.

```
repositories {
   ...
   maven {
           url  "https://cardinalcommerceprod.jfrog.io/artifactory/android"
           credentials {
                   username Artifactory username
                   password Artifactory user API Key
            }
    }
}
dependencies {
    ...
    //Cardinal Mobile SDK
    implementation 2.5-1
}                
        
```

If your project uses Progurad, add the lines shown below to the *proguard-rules.pro* file.

```
-keep class com.cardinalcommerce.dependencies.internal.bouncycastle.**
-keep class com.cardinalcommerce.dependencies.internal.nimbusds.**
    
```

Configuring the Android SDK {#reference_hrm_syd_xpb}
====================================================

Get the instance of the Cardinal object by running the *Cardinal.getInstance()* process. Use the default configuration options. See the example below to understand how to run the *Cardinal.configure()* process.  
For more details on configuration, refer to the configuration options table after the example.

```
private Cardinal cardinal = Cardinal.getInstance();
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {

CardinalConfigurationParameters cardinalConfigurationParameters = new CardinalConfigurationParameters();
        cardinalConfigurationParameters.setEnvironment(CardinalEnvironment.STAGING);
        cardinalConfigurationParameters.setTimeout(8000);
        JSONArray rType = new JSONArray();
        rType.put(CardinalRenderType.OTP);
        rType.put(CardinalRenderType.SINGLE_SELECT);
        rType.put(CardinalRenderType.MULTI_SELECT);
        rType.put(CardinalRenderType.OOB);
        rType.put(CardinalRenderType.HTML);
        cardinalConfigurationParameters.setRenderType(rType);

        cardinalConfigurationParameters.setUiType(CardinalUiType.BOTH);

[Android Configuration Options]

Setting Up the Initial Request {#reference_usw_hb2_xpb}
=======================================================

Run the *Cardinal.init()* process to:

* Begin the communication process with Cardinal.
* Authenticate your credentials (server JWT).
* Complete the data collection process.

{#reference_usw_hb2_xpb_ul_zns_dwc_fwb}  
By the time the customer is ready to check out, all necessary preprocessing is complete.  
Each time a user begins a mobile transaction, Cardinal assigns a unique identifier to the consumer session called a consumerSessionId. This consumerSessionId ensures that Cardinal matches the correct device data collection results to a request. `Payment Gateway` calls this session identifier payerAuthEnrollService_referenceID. You must assign the value of the consumerSessionId field to the payerAuthEnrollService_referenceID field so that `Payment Gateway` can also track the calls for each user session.  
Study the code example shown below for completing the *cardinal.init()* process. Cardinal.init() (Android SDK)

```
cardinal = Cardinal.getInstance();
String serverJwt = "INSERT_YOUR_JWT_HERE";
cardinal.init(serverJwt ,
new CardinalInitService() {
    /**
    * You may have your Submit button disabled on page load. Once you are 
    * set up for CCA, you may then enable it. This will prevent users 
    * from submitting their order before CCA is ready.
    */
    @Override
    public void onSetupCompleted(String consumerSessionId) {
  
    }
    /**
    * If there was an error with set up, Cardinal will call this function
    * with validate response and empty serverJWT
    * @param validateResponse
    * @param serverJwt will be an empty
    */
    @Override
    public void onValidated(ValidateResponse validateResponse, String serverJwt) {
  
    }
});
```

Using the iOS SDK {#concept_blv_1bc_fqb}
========================================

A mobile SDK is available for integrating payer authentication services into mobile applications running on the iOS platform.

Downloading and Importing the SDK {#reference_h5r_rr2_xpb}
==========================================================

Download the *CardinalMobile.framework* file using the cURL program in this example.  
Download CardinalMobile.framework

```
curl -L -u &lt;USER_NAME&gt;
        :&lt;API_KEY&gt; https://cardinalcommerceprod.jfrog.io/artifactory/ios/&lt;VERSION&gt;-&lt;BUILD_NUMBER&gt;/cardinalmobilesdk.zip
        -o &lt;LOCAL_FILE_NAME.EXT&gt;

#Example: 
curl -L -u UserName:ApiKey "https://cardinalcommerceprod.jfrog.io/artifactory/ios/2.2.5-1/cardinalmobilesdk.zip" -o cardinalmobile2.2.5-1.zip                          
```

Download the *CardinalMobile.xcframework* file using the cURL in this example.  
Download CardinalMobile.xcframework

```
curl -L -u &lt;USER_NAME&gt;
        :&lt;API_KEY&gt; https://cardinalcommerceprod.jfrog.io/artifactory/ios/&lt;VERSION&gt;-&lt;BUILD_NUMBER&gt;/CardinalMobileiOSXC.zip
        -o &lt;LOCAL_FILE_NAME.EXT&gt;

#Example: 
curl -L -u UserName:ApiKey "https://cardinalcommerceprod.jfrog.io/artifactory/ios/2.2.5-1/CardinalMobileiOSXC.zip" -o cardinalmobile2.2.5-1.zip
```

In your XCode project, drag the *CardinalMobile.framework* file into the Frameworks group in your Xcode Project. (Create the group if it does not already exist.) In the import dialog box, check the box to Copy items into the destinations group folder (or Destination: Copy items if needed). The iOS SDK files are now available for linking in your project.

Configuring Your Build Environment {#task_bbs_hr2_xpb}
======================================================

Follow these to configure your build environment:

1. Open Xcode, and in the source list to the left of the main editor area, choose your project.
2. Under the Targets section, select your application and open the **General** tab.
3. Expand the Embedded Binaries section and click the small plus (**+**) at the bottom of the list.
4. From the list, add the **CardinalMobile.framework** file.

Configuring the iOS SDK {#reference_sr5_1c2_xpb}
================================================

Use **CardinalSession new** to create a new instance of the cardinal object. Use the default configuration options. Study these examples to complete the iOS SDK configuration.  
For more details on configuration options, refer to the table after the examples.  
CardinalSession new (iOS SDK - Objective-C)

//Setup can be called in viewDidLoad
- (void)setupCardinalSession {
    session = [CardinalSession new]; 
    CardinalSessionConfiguration *config = [CardinalSessionConfiguration new];
    config.deploymentEnvironment = CardinalSessionEnvironmentProduction;
    config.timeout = CardinalSessionTimeoutStandard;
    config.uiType = CardinalSessionUITypeBoth;

    UiCustomization *yourCustomUi = [[UiCustomization alloc] init];
    //Set various customizations here. See "iOS UI Customization" documentation for detail.
    config.uiCustomization = yourCustomUi;
 
    CardinalSessionRenderTypeArray *renderType = [[CardinalSessionRenderTypeArray alloc] initWithObjects:
                               CardinalSessionRenderTypeOTP,
                               CardinalSessionRenderTypeHTML,
                               nil];
    config.renderType = renderType;
 
    config.enableQuickAuth = false;
    [session configure:config];
}                         
```

CardinalSession new (iOS SDK - Swift)

```
import CardinalMobile

var session : CardinalSession!
 
//Setup can be called in viewDidLoad
func setupCardinalSession{
    session = CardinalSession()
    var config = CardinalSessionConfiguration()
    config.deploymentEnvironment = .production
    config.timeout = 8000
    config.uiType = .both
 
    let yourCustomUi = UiCustomization()
    //Set various customizations here. See "iOS UI Customization" documentation for detail.
    config.uiCustomization = yourCustomUi
 
    config.renderType = [CardinalSessionRenderTypeOTP, CardinalSessionRenderTypeHTML]
    config.enableQuickAuth = true
    session.configure(config)
}

[iOS Configuration Options]

Setting Up the Initial Request {#reference_ezk_h1f_xpb}
=======================================================

Requesting the *cardinal session setup* process begins the communication process, authenticates your credentials (server JWT), and completes the data collection process. By the time the customer is ready to check out, all necessary preprocessing is complete.  
Each time a user begins a mobile transaction, a unique value is assigned to the consumerSessionId API field to identify the session. This value ensures that the correct device data collection results are matched to each user request. `Payment Gateway` uses its payerAuthEnrollService_referenceID field to contain Cardinal's consumerSessionId value. You must assign the value of the consumerSessionId field to the payerAuthEnrollService_referenceID field so that `Payment Gateway` can also track the requests for each user session.  
Study these code examples to understand how to complete setting up the cardinal session process. The function request must be placed in your Checkout ViewController. Cardinal session setup (iOS SDK - Objective-C)

```
NSString *accountNumberString = @"1234567890123456";
NSString *jwtString = @"INSERT_YOUR_JWT_HERE";
 
[session setupWithJWT:jwtString 
          didComplete:^(NSString * _Nonnull consumerSessionId){
//
    // You may have your Submit button disabled on page load. Once you are 
    // setup for CCA, you may then enable it. This will prevent users 
    // from submitting their order before CCA is ready.
    //
} didValidate:^(CardinalResponse * _Nonnull validateResponse) {
    // Handle failed setup
    // If there was an error with setup, cardinal will call this 
    // function with validate response and empty serverJWT
}];                           
```

Cardinal session setup (iOS SDK - Swift)

```
let accountNumberString = "1234567890123456"
let jwtString = "INSERT_YOUR_JWT_HERE"

session.setup(jwtString: jwtString, completed: { (consumerSessionId: String) in
    //
    // You may have your Submit button disabled on page load. Once you 
    // are setup for CCA, you may then enable it. This will prevent 
    // users from submitting their order before CCA is ready.
    //
}) { (validateResponse: CardinalResponse) in
    // Handle failed setup
    // If there was an error with setup, cardinal will call this

}                           
```

Running Payer Authentication with SDK {#concept_u35_4hn_xpb}
============================================================

The payer authentication process in SDK requires checking whether a customer is participating in a card authentication program. If the customer is enrolled in payer authentication, you validate their current status in the program and authorize the transaction. The following procedures describe how to ensure the correct data values are passed during the payer authentication process.

Requesting the Check Enrollment Service (SDK) {#pa-sdk-implementing-sdk-request-check-enrollment}
=================================================================================================

After the SDK completes the device collection from your mobile application, and after the customer clicks the Buy button, you must make a back-end, server-to-server call to request the Enrollment Check service.  
The Check Enrollment service verifies that the card is enrolled in a card authentication program. The merchant ID is included as part of the header, but these fields are required in the request:
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.referenceId

* orderInformation.amountDetails.currency

* orderInformation.amountDetails.totalAmount

* orderInformation.billTo.address1

* orderInformation.billTo.administrativeArea

* orderInformation.billTo.country

* orderInformation.billTo.email

* orderInformation.billTo.firstName

* orderInformation.billTo.lastName

* orderInformation.billTo.locality

* orderInformation.billTo.postalCode

* paymentInformation.card.expirationMonth

* paymentInformation.card.expirationYear

* paymentInformation.card.number

* paymentInformation.card.type
  {#pa-sdk-implementing-sdk-request-check-enrollment_ul_g5b_zbh_hqb}
  IMPORTANT To reduce your issuer step-up authentication rates, you can send additional request data in the order. It is best to send all available fields.  
  Use the enrollment check and card authorization services in the same request or in separate requests:

* Same request: `Payment Gateway` attempts to authorize the card if your customer is not enrolled in a payer authentication program. In this case, the field values that are required to prove that you attempted to check enrollment are passed automatically to the authorization service. If authentication is required, processing automatically stops.

* Separate requests: Manually include the enrollment check result values (Enrollment Check response fields) in the authorization service request (Card Authorization request fields).

{#pa-sdk-implementing-sdk-request-check-enrollment_ul_nnr_h2f_xpb}  
Be sure to include the following card-specific information in your authorization request:

* For Relay, JCB, China UnionPay, Elo, Diners Club, Discover and American Express include the CAVV.
* For Mastercard only, include the collection indicator and the AAV (also known as UCAF).

{#pa-sdk-implementing-sdk-request-check-enrollment_ul_hyb_lvz_pyb}  
These fields are listed in this table.

[Enrollment Check and Response Fields]

Interpreting the Response {#concept_eyw_mff_xpb}
================================================

In EMV `3-D Secure`, there are two possible responses:

* Frictionless: No challenge or stepup to the cardholder. While frictionless authentication can indicate a successfully authenticated outcome because the customer's card is enrolled in a payer authentication program, it can also result from the bank failing or rejecting authentication without challenging the cardholder. In the frictionless authentication flow, you receive a PAResStatus of either `Y`, `A`, `N`, `I`, `R`, or `U` with an associated ECI value. With successful frictionless authentication, the PAResStatus = `Y` or `A` and you receive a CAVV. You may also receive a PAResStatus = `I` indicating successful authentication, but it might not include a CAVV.
* Challenge: The response contains PAResStatus = `C`. A challenge response has a payload and contains an ACS URL and a step up URL. Challenge the cardholder to provide additional authentication information and display an authentication challenge window to the cardholder so the cardholder can respond to a validation request and receive a validation response.

Authenticating Enrolled Cards {#concept_ibq_jhf_xpb}
====================================================

In the response from the enrollment check service, confirm that you receive these fields and values:

* `3-D Secure` version = 2.x
* VERes enrolled = Y
* PARes status = C

{#concept_ibq_jhf_xpb_ul_chl_nhf_xpb}  
These values identify whether it is an EMV `3-D Secure` 2.x transaction and that a challenge is required.  
After you validate these fields, you request the *Cardinal.cca_continue* process (Android SDK) or the *Cardinal session continue*process (iOS SDK) for the SDK to perform the challenge between the customer and the issuing bank.

Calling Cardinal.cca_continue (Android SDK) {#reference_rqz_shf_xpb}
====================================================================

After you verify that a customer's card is enrolled in a card authentication program, you must include the payload and the consumerAuthenticationInformation.authenticationTransactionId response field and incorporate them into the*Cardinal.cca_continue* function as shown in this example before proceeding with the authentication session.

```
/**
 * Cca continue.
 *
 * @param transactionId     the transaction id
 * @param payload           the payload
 * @param currentActivity   the current activity
 * @throws InvalidInputException        the invalid input exception
 * @throws JSONException                the json exception
 * @throws UnsupportedEncodingException the unsupported encoding exception
 */
try {
    cardinal.cca_continue("[TRANSACTION ID ]", "[PAYLOAD]", this, new CardinalValidateReceiver() {
           /**
            * This method is triggered when the transaction 
            * has been terminated. This is how SDK hands back
            * control to the merchant's application. This method will
            * include data on how the transaction attempt ended and
            * you should have your logic for reviewing the results of
            * the transaction and making decisions regarding next steps.
            * JWT will be empty if validate was not successful.
            *
            * @param validateResponse
            * @param serverJWT
            */
           @Override
           public void onValidated(Context currentContext, ValidateResponse validateResponse, String serverJWT) {
           }
       });
 }
catch (Exception e) {
   // Handle exception
 }          
```

Calling Cardinal session continue (iOS SDK) {#reference_isy_1jf_xpb}
====================================================================

When you have verified that a customer's card is enrolled in a card authentication program, include the payload, and the response field and incorporate them into the *Cardinal session continue* function before proceeding with the authentication session.  
In the *Cardinal session continue* function, you should pass a class conforming to the *CardinalValidationDelegate* protocol (and implement the *stepUpDidValidate* method) as a parameter. These examples show a class conforming to the *CardinalValidationDelegate* protocol.

*Objective-C Examples*
----------------------

Cardinal session continue (iOS SDK - Objective-C)

```
@interface YourViewController()&lt;CardinalValidationDelegate&gt;{ //Conform your ViewController or any other class to CardinalValidationDelegate protocol
   
}
@end
  
@implementation YourViewController
  
    /**
     * This method is triggered when the transaction has 
     * been terminated.This is how SDK hands back
     * control to the merchant's application. This method will
     * include data on how the transaction attempt ended and
     * you should have your logic for reviewing the results of
     * the transaction and making decisions regarding next steps.
     * JWT will be empty if validate was not successful
     *
     * @param session
     * @param validateResponse
     * @param serverJWT
     */
    -(void)cardinalSession:(CardinalSession *)session stepUpDidValidateWithResponse:(CardinalResponse *)validateResponse serverJWT:(NSString *)serverJWT{
       
    }
  
@end                         
```

If the *Cardinal.continue* process is requested in the same class, request the method shown in the following example to start the step up flow.  
Cardinal.continue Request in the Same Class (Objective-C)

```
[session continueWithTransactionId: @"[TRANSACTION_ID]"
                           payload: @"[PAYLOAD]"
               didValidateDelegate: self];                           
```

*Swift Examples*
----------------

Cardinal session continue (iOS SDK - Swift)

```
class YourViewController:CardinalValidationDelegate {
  
    /**
     * This method is triggered when the transaction has been 
     * terminated.This is how SDK hands back
     * control to the merchant's application. This method will
     * include data on how the transaction attempt ended and
     * you should have your logic for reviewing the results of
     * the transaction and making decisions regarding next steps.
     * JWT will be empty if validate was not successful
     *
     * @param session
     * @param validateResponse
     * @param serverJWT
     */
    func cardinalSession(cardinalSession session: CardinalSession!, stepUpValidated validateResponse: CardinalResponse!, serverJWT: String!) {
        
    }
 
}                          
```

If the *Cardinal.continue* function is requested in the same class, request the method shown in the example below to start the step up flow.  
Cardinal.continue Request in the Same Class (Swift)

```
session.continueWith(transactionId: "[TRANSACTION_ID]", payload: "[PAYLOAD]", validationDelegate: self)            
```

When necessary, the SDK displays the authentication window and the customer enters their authentication information.

Receiving the Authentication Results {#reference_ezc_23n_xpb}
=============================================================

Next, the *onValidated()* function (Android SDK) or the *stepUpDidValidate* function (iOS SDK) launches and returns the authentication results and response JWT along with the processor transaction ID as shown in this example. Decoded Response JWT

```
{
  "iss": "5a4504be6fe3d1127cdfd94e",
  "iat": 1555075930,
  "exp": 1555083130,
  "jti": "cc532159-636d-4fa8-931d-d4b0f4c83b99",
  "ConsumerSessionId": "0_9a16b7f5-8b94-480d-bf92-09cd302c9230",
  "aud": "d0cf3392-62c5-4107-bf6a-8fc3bb49922b",
  "Payload": {
    "Payment": {
      "Type": "CCA",
      "ProcessorTransactionId": "YGSaOBivyG0dzCFs2Zv0"
    },
    "ErrorNumber": 0,
    "ErrorDescription": "Success"
  }
}                           
```

Requesting the Validation Service {#pa-sdk-implementing-request-validation}
===========================================================================

For enrolled cards, the next step is to make a back-end, server-to-server request for the validation service.  
When you make the validation request, you must:

* Send the consumerAuthenticationInformation.authenticationTransactionId request field.
* Send the credit card information including the PAN, currency, and expiration date (month and year).

{#pa-sdk-implementing-request-validation_ul_qc4_5yf_xpb}  
The response that you receive contains the validation result.  
It is recommended that you request the payer authentication and card authorization services at the same time. Doing so automatically sends the correct information to your payment processor and converts the values of these fields to the proper format required by your payment processor:

* consumerAuthenticationInformation.ecommerceIndicator
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.cavv
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.ucafAuthenticationData
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.xid and consumerAuthenticationInformation.xid

{#pa-sdk-implementing-request-validation_ul_x5n_czf_xpb}  
If you request the services separately, manually include the validation result values (Validation Check response fields) in the authorization service request (Card Authorization request fields). To receive liability shift protection, you must ensure that you pass all pertinent data for the card type and processor in your request. Failure to do so might invalidate your liability shift for that transaction. Include the electronic commerce indicator (ECI), the transaction ID (XID), the 3-D Secure version, the directory server transaction ID, and this card-specific information in your authorization request.

* For Relay, JCB,, China UnionPay, Elo, Diners Club, Discover, and American Express include the CAVV.
* For Mastercard only, include the collection indicator and the AAV (also known as UCAF).

[Validation Check and Response Fields]

Interpreting the Response {#pa-sdk-implementing-request-validation-interpreting-response}
=========================================================================================

> IMPORTANT
> If the authentication fails, Relay, Diners Club, Discover, JCB, China UnionPay, Elo, and American Express require that you not accept the card. Instead, you must ask the customer to use another payment method.  
> Proceed with the order according to the validation response received. The responses are similar for all card types:

* Success: You receive `AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESSFUL`, and other service requests, including authorization, are processed normally.
* Failure: You receive `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`, so the other services in your request are not processed.
* Error: If you receive an error from the payment card company, process the order according to your business rules. If the error occurs frequently, report it to [customer support](http://support.example.com ""). If you receive a system error, determine the cause, and proceed with card authorization only if appropriate.

{#pa-sdk-implementing-request-validation-interpreting-response_ul_psm_fxf_xpb}  
To verify that the enrollment and validation checks are for the same transaction, ensure that the XID in the enrollment check and validation responses are identical.

Redirecting Customers to the Message Page {#concept_ujz_wvf_xpb}
================================================================

After authentication is complete, redirect the customer to a page containing a success or failure message. Ensure that all messages that display to customers are accurate, complete, and address all possible scenarios for enrolled and non-enrolled cards. For example, if the authentication fails, display a message such as this to the customer:

```
Authentication Failed
Your card issuer cannot authenticate this card. Please select another card or form of payment to complete your purchase.
```

Authentication Examples Using Primary Account Numbers {#concept_g2r_dgx_qxb}
============================================================================

These examples list the API fields that are required or optional for the Setup, Check Enrollment, and Validate Authentication services. An example of a request payload and a successful response that occur with each service is provided. Payer authentication has three types of examples:
* Primary Account Number (PAN): Illustrates how the payer authentication services work with customer PANs during transactions.

Non-Payment Authentication {#pa2-check-enroll-use-npa-intro}
============================================================

Non-Payment Authentication (NPA) requests enable a merchant to authenticate a customer without a transaction. A non-payment use case can be used for such tasks as adding a card to a merchant website, updating cardholder information on file, or to verify a cardholder's identity when creating a token for future use. The same authentication used during the checking enrollment process is used for NPA. Non-payment use cases are enabled using a combination of the consumerAuthenticationInformation.messageCategory and consumerAuthenticationInformation.strongAuthentication.authenticationIndicator values. For example to add a card to a loyalty program, set the Message Category value to `02` and the Authentication Indicator value to `04`. For other possible NPA use cases, refer to the other possible values for consumerAuthenticationInformation.messageCategory. The consumerAuthenticationInformation.messageCategory value must be set to `02` (non-payment authentication) to specify that the authentication is not for a transaction.

Examples Using `3-D Secure` Data Only {#concept_pjv_tsp_bfc}
============================================================

`3-D Secure` Data Only is a solution that shares data that merchants collect during transactions with the issuer, so that the issuers can make more informed authorization decisions for future transactions. Data Only uses the `3-D Secure` infrastructure, but it is not a complete `3-D Secure` authentication. `3-D Secure` Data Only is a frictionless experience.  
Data Only can increase authorization approvals and reduce fraud in the following ways:

* Merchants share additional transaction data with the issuer, allowing the issuer to feel more comfortable with the transaction's risk level. The issuer can gain additional insight into who the buyer is and what they are purchasing which enables better authorization decisions.

* Since Data Only is not a full authentication, merchants retain fraud liability, putting less risk on the issuers, which might lead to a higher approval rate when compared to non-authenticated transactions.
  {#concept_pjv_tsp_bfc_ul_hhw_ctp_bfc}  
  Relay supports the Relay Data Only program, and Mastercard has two options for Data Only. These Mastercard options are:

* Mastercard Data Share Only: This option mirrors the Relay Data Only program by allowing the AReq message to reach the Issuer. The Issuer can then obtain all of the enhanced data and link that information on the authorization message.

* Mastercard Identity Check Insights: This option stops the AReq at the Mastercard Directory Server. Mastercard returns a Data Only response to the merchant and then passes a risk score outside of the transaction flow to the Issuer that the Issurer can append to the authorization to aid in their decision process.
  {#concept_pjv_tsp_bfc_ul_qrp_z5g_rhc}

Relay Data Only {#concept_v1v_fpv_bfc}
=====================================

Relay has a data only data flow so that merchants can share customer data with the issuers without going through authentication. The additional data provided to the issuer helps the issuer make risk assessments about approving cardholder transactions. Data only data flows are frictionless and do not affect the customer experience. When sending a Relay data only check enrollment request, be sure to include all of the required fields and set the consumerAuthenticationInformation.challengeCode field to `06`.  
The response from the data only request will include this data:

* ECI = `07`
* PARes = `I`
* \&lt;CAVV\&gt; value

{#concept_v1v_fpv_bfc_ul_gdj_4qr_cfc}  
This data from the response must be included in the authorization request.

Mastercard Data Only {#concept_itw_3pv_bfc}
===========================================

Mastercard has a Data Only data flow so that merchants can share customer data with the issuers without going through authentication. The additional data provided to the issuer helps the issuer make risk assessments about approving cardholder transactions. Data Only data flows are frictionless and do not affect the customer experience.  
When sending a Mastercard Data Only check enrollment request, be sure to include all of the required fields and set the consumerAuthenticationInformation.challengeCode to `06`.  
The response from the Data Only request includes this data:
* ECI = `06`
* CAVV value
* Directory server transaction ID
* paresStatus = `I`
* Risk score
* Reason code
  {#concept_itw_3pv_bfc_ul_pdw_v4r_cfc}  
  This data from the response must be included in the authorization request.

Mastercard Identity Check Insights (IDCI) {#pa2-use-data-only-mc-intro-idci}
============================================================================

Mastercard has an IDCI data flow so that merchants can share customer data with the issuers without going through authentication. Unlike the Data Only flow, the AReq remains at the Mastercard Directory Server. Using the device information and additional data, Mastercard calculates a risk score for the transaction that is then shared with the issuer during authorization. The additional data provided to the issuer helps the issuer make risk assessments about approving cardholder transactions. Mastercard IDCI data flows are frictionless and do not affect the customer experience.  
When sending a Mastercard IDCI check enrollment request, be sure to include all of the required fields and set the consumerAuthenticationInformation.messageCategory to `80`.  
The response from the IDCI request includes this data:
* ECI = `04`
* CAVV value
* Directory server transaction ID
* paresStatus = `U`
* Risk score
* Reason code
  {#pa2-use-data-only-mc-intro-idci_ul_pdw_v4r_cfc}  
  This data from the response must be included in the authorization request.

Endpoint
--------

**Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/pts/v2/payments`  
**Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/pts/v2/payments`

Required Fields for Mastercard IDCI {#pa2-use-data-only-mc-reqd-fields-idci}
============================================================================

These fields are the minimum fields required when you request the Mastercard Data Only IDCI service. Under certain circumstances, a field that normally is optional might be required. The circumstance that makes an optional field required is noted.

> IMPORTANT
> Merchants should ensure that they run the device collection and ` 3-D Secure ` Method URL portions of the flow before sending in the pa_enroll request.

Authentication Examples of Merchant-Initiated Transactions {#pa-3ri-intro}
==========================================================================

A 3RI transaction is an EMV `3-D Secure` transaction that is initiated by the merchant instead of the cardholder. The merchant keeps the payment data from the initial payment so that the cardholder does not have to be present for subsequent 3RI transactions. Having the payment details from a previous transaction enables the merchant to obtain a new Cardholder Authentication Verification Value (CAVV) to authenticate when authorizing future payments.  
The authorization request contains the consumerAuthenticationInformation.deviceChannel field. This process can be applied to these types of transactions:

* Recurring payments: payments occur at regular intervals for an indefinite interval like subscription services.
* Installment payments: payments occur at regular intervals for a fixed interval.
* Refunded purchases: the cost of an item is refunded before the item is received. Any charges for damage or missing items can be charged back to the customer using a 3RI transaction.
* Delayed shipments: an ordered item is out of stock delaying the shipment until the item is back in stock.
* Split payments: an order is fulfilled in split shipments rather than in a single shipment because one of multiple items in the order is temporarily out of stock.
* Multiple party commerce: a single entity or party makes multiple transactions with different merchants, for example, a travel agent booking flights, hotels, and tour excursions.
* Unknown final transaction amount: extra charges are made to the customer for items such as hotel services, driving citations, or tips.
  {#pa-3ri-intro_ul_rxx_nz1_zcc}

Challenge Reponses to 3RI Transactions {#pa-3ri-intro-challenge-response}
=========================================================================

The directory server prohibits any challenge response from an issuer in 3RI transactions because the cardholder is not present for authentication. If an issuer does respond with a challenge, the directory server:  
• Returns an ARes with a Transaction Status (transStatus) = `N` and a Transaction Status Reason (transStatusReason) = `87` (Transaction is excluded from Attempts Processing) to the `3-D Secure` Server (merchant).  
• Sends an error message (Erro) to the Access Control Server (ACS), with Error Code (errorCode) = `203` (Format of one or more data elements is invalid according to the specification.)  
When you receive this response, you should find an alternate way of processing the transaction. Examples include going directly to authorization, or when the cardholder is present, resending the transaction. When you receive this response, contact your acquirer to raise the issue with customer support.  
For Merchant Initiated Transactions which are expected to be frictionless, device details are not required in the MIT authentication transaction

Network-Specific Values for Multi-Party Commerce/Online Travel Agency (OTA) {#network_specific_values_for_3ri}
==============================================================================================================

When the request body requires a previous authentication reference ID (consumerAuthenticationInformation.priorAuthenticationReferenceId), use the network-specific value found in one of these fields in the original response.

* Relay: consumerAuthenticationInformation.acsTransactionId
* Mastercard: consumerAuthenticationInformation.directoryServerTransactionId

{#network_specific_values_for_3ri_ul_pxm_g5g_zcc}  
When the request body requires a value from the consumerAuthenticationInformation.requestorInitiatedAuthenticationIndicator field and the 3RI transaction type is multi-party commerce, use use one of these network-specific values.

* Relay: `11` (Other payment)
* Mastercard: `85` (Agent payment)

{#network_specific_values_for_3ri_ul_qxm_g5g_zcc}  
Note that Mastercard uses the Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI) value of `07` for 3RI transactions.  
The network specific values for Multi Party Commerce / OTA are below.  
IMPORTANT The test card numbers that are provided are formatted with Xs for zeroes in the card number. When testing with the card numbers, replace the Xs with a 0 (zero).

1a: Initial Recurring Transaction {#pa-3ri-1a-test-initial-first-recur-txn}
===========================================================================

In this instance, the merchant initiates a 3RI recurring transaction that is a fixed amount for a set of transactions with no established expiration, such as with a subscription purchase.

|       **Card Type**        | **Test Card Number** |

2a: Installment - Customer Initiated Transaction (Mastercard) {#pa-3ri-2a-test-install-cust-initiated-txn-mc}

In this instance, the initial authentication is for the total amount for all of the future installments. Once the initial authentication is completed by the customer, the subsequent installments do not require authentication and go directly to authorization, which is Mastercard's preferred process.

Testing Payer Authentication {#pa-testing-intro}
================================================

After you complete the necessary changes to your web and API integration, verify that all components are working correctly by performing all the tests for the cards that you support. Each test contains the specific input data and the most important result fields that you receive in the API response.

Testing Process {#pa_testing_process}
=====================================

Use the card number specified in the test with the card's expiration date set to the month of December and the current year plus three. For example, for 2025, use 2028. The test card numbers that are provided are formatted with Xs for zeroes in the card number. When testing with the card numbers, replace a X with a 0 (zero). You also need the minimum required fields for an order.

Enrollment Check Response Fields {#pa_testing_response_fields}

Test Cases for `3-D Secure` 2.x {#concept_uwj_cxc_zpb}
======================================================

Use the card number specified in the test with the card expiration date set to the month of January and the current year plus three. For example, for 2026, use 2029. You also need the minimum required fields for an order.  
Be sure to remove spaces in card numbers when testing.  
IMPORTANT The test card numbers that are provided are formatted with Xs for zeroes in the card number. When testing with the card numbers, replace the Xs with a 0 (zero).  
While the usage of transaction ID (XID) values have declined in importance, they are still included in `3-D Secure` 2.x test cases. Only Mastercard transactions do not return XIDs.  
While the `3-D Secure` version and directory server transaction ID fields are returned for the Check Enrollment and Validate Authentication services, this data is not included in the `3-D Secure` 2.x test cases.

> IMPORTANT
> Mastercard requires that the ` 3-D Secure ` version and directory server transaction ID be included along with all pertinent data in your authorization request.

Card Specific Setup
-------------------

The cards listed below require a specific merchant attribute or configuration during testing.

* `eftpos`: The merchant should request that customer support enable the preferred secondary brand attribute to enable the prerferred routing for eftpos.
* mada: The merchant descriptor country should be set as `SA` and the card type should be set as `mada`.
* Meeza: The merchant descriptor country should be set as `EG` and the card type should be set as `Meeza`

Validation does not apply to this test because no validation is needed when no challenge is issued during the transaction.

Action
------

If you request Check Enrollment and Authorization services separately, add the required payer authentication values to your authorization request. If you request the Check Enrollment and authorization services together, the process described above occurs automatically.

No results are returned.

Action
------

Submit your authorization request. There is no liability shift.

2.14: Require Method URL {#reference_fxw_qjk_wqb}
=================================================

This test ensures that the merchant is allowing sufficient time (10 seconds) for the issuer to complete device data collection.

Card Numbers
------------

The Method URL process runs before the authentication request to ensure device data is collected properly. The enrollment check of the card account should not start until after the device data collection (DDC) response is received. This test verifies that there is enough time to collect the BIN of the issuer and to transmit it. This test attempts to collect the nine-digit BIN of the card number and verifies that the delay between the DDC request and the response is at least 7 seconds long. The test fails when fewer than nine digits of the BIN are collected or when the delay between the DDC request and response is too short in duration.  
Do not run this test when your system does not collect device data. When device data is not collected, an older version of the EMV`3-D Secure` protocol is automatically used, and the transaction is automatically assessed as a higher risk.

| **Network** | **ECI Raw Value** |
|-------------|-------------------|

Action
------

If your device data collection method implements correctly and EMV `3-D Secure` processing occurs, the test transaction produces a Frictionless Success result. A failure is indicated when PARes status = `C`. With the failure, a warning message opens to explain the cause of the test failure.

Additional Test Cases {#concept_q2j_r4w_jrb}
============================================

These test cases cover payer authentication scenarios that can occur outside of typical testing. These special use cases might require including additional API fields to accommodate different data that is necessary for that test.
IMPORTANT The test card numbers that are provided are formatted with Xs for zeroes in the card number. When testing with the card numbers, replace a X with a 0 (zero).

1a: First Recurring Transaction: Fixed Amount {#reference_pdg_pqv_frb}
======================================================================

The merchant initiates a 3RI recurring transaction of a fixed amount for a specified number of transactions or with no set number of transactions such as occurs with subscription purchases.

Card Network and Version Specifications
---------------------------------------

Relay Secure 2.1 does not support this type of transaction. Relay Secure 2.2 test cards are in development.  
For Mastercard Identity Check 2.1, 3RI is not supported for Payer Authentication. Only the initial transaction is supported for recurring payments.  
If you attempt to run a Device Channel of 3RI within Mastercard Identity Check 2.1, you receive a transStatusReason=21 (3RI Transaction not supported) reason and a transaction status of `U` rather than `Y`.  
In EMV `3-D Secure` 2.2, Mastercard allocated a new ECI value, ECI 07, for 3RI transactions. It is present on a Mastercard response message for this particular 3RI scenario. For EMV `3-D Secure` 2.1, Mastercard will continue to use ECI 02.

2a: Card Authentication Failed {#reference_udd_wqv_frb}
=======================================================

This scenario tests how your system reacts to various Trans Status Reasons (failed, suspected fraud, and similar instances). When PAResStatus = N, the CardholderInfo field can be returned by the card issuer. When this cardholder information is returned, you must display this information within your checkout experience.

Website Modification Reference {#concept_ifc_wp3_ypb}
=====================================================

This section describes how to modify your website to integrate Payer Authentication services into your checkout process. It also provides links to payment card company websites where you can download the appropriate logos.

Website Modification Checklist {#concept_rgx_wq3_ypb}
=====================================================

Modify web page buttons:

* Order submission button: Disable the final "buy" button until the customer completes all payment and authentication requirements.
* Browser back button: Plan for unexpected customer behavior. Check throughout the authentication process so you do not authenticate transactions twice. Avoid confusing messages, such as warnings about expired pages.

{#concept_rgx_wq3_ypb_ul_pgf_1r3_ypb}  
Add appropriate logos:

* Download the appropriate logos of the cards that you support. Place these logos next to the card information entry fields on your checkout pages. For more information about obtaining logos and using them, see [EMV 3-D Secure Service Logos](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa-website-modification-reference-intro/pa-website-modification-reference-3d-secure-servic.md "").

{#concept_rgx_wq3_ypb_ul_t3s_1r3_ypb}  
Add informational message:
* Add a message next to the final "buy" button and the card logo to inform your customers that they might be prompted to provide their authentication password.

Informational Message Examples {#concept_lbh_tr3_ypb}
=====================================================

Add a brief message next to the final buy button on your checkout page to inform customers that they might be prompted for their authentication password or to enroll in the authentication program for their card.  
These examples might be used, but consult your specific card authentication program to make sure you conform to their messaging requirements.
Example
To help prevent unauthorized use of *\&lt;card_type\&gt;* cards online, *\&lt;your_business_name\&gt;* participates in *\&lt;card_authentication_program\&gt;* . When you submit your order, you might receive a *\&lt;card_authentication_program\&gt;* message from your *\&lt;card_type\&gt;* card issuer. If your card or issuer does not participate in the program, you are returned to our secure checkout to complete your order. Please wait while the transaction is processed. Do not click the Back button or close the browser window. Example
Your card might be eligible for Relay Secure, Mastercard, Maestro, American Express SafeKey, JCB J/Secure, Diners Club ProtectBuy, or Discover ProtectBuy programs. After you submit your order, your card issuer might prompt you to authenticate yourself. This authentication can be done through a one-time pass code sent to your phone or email, by biometrics, or some other form of authentication.

Finding Payer Authentication Transaction Details in the `Business Center` {#pa-transx-details-in-ebc-intro}
===========================================================================================================

This section describes how to find the details of Payer Authentication transactions in the `Business Center`. You need certain information about a transaction to respond to a chargeback. For details about past transactions, from the left navigation pane, go to Transaction Management \&gt; Transactions. This detailed data about a past transaction is stored for 12 months.

Searching for Transactions {#concept_wgx_nk3_ypb}
=================================================

You can search for transactions that used the payer authentication and card authorization services by going to Transactions Management \&gt; Transactions. When searching for transactions, consider these things:

* Search options:
  * To find the details of a transaction, on the Transactions page enter its PA Transaction ID into the Quick Search field.
  * On the Transactions page, you can also create a payer authentication transaction ID filter by clicking Add filter and selecting `PA Transaction ID` as the filter. You can then enter the transaction ID as the filter criteria.
  * The list of applications is simplified to facilitate searching for the relevant service requests.
  * Payer authentication information is available for 12 months after the transaction date.
    {#concept_wgx_nk3_ypb_ul_myg_sk3_ypb}
* Search results: the results options include the Payer Authentication transaction ID and the customer's account number (PAN). Use the Payer Authentication transaction ID to find all parts of the transaction.
* Payer authentication details: all transaction details are discussed under Searching for Payer Authentication Details. For more information, see [Searching for Payer Authentication Details](/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa-transx-details-in-ebc-intro/pa-transx-details-in-ebc-searching-pa-details.md "").
  {#concept_wgx_nk3_ypb_ul_gt1_sk3_ypb}

Storing Payer Authentication Data {#pa-part-tranx-details-ebc-storing-pa-data}
==============================================================================

Payment card companies permit only a certain number of days between the payer authentication and the authorization request. If you settle transactions that are older than the predetermined number of days, payment card companies might require that you send them the AAV, CAVV, or the XID when a chargeback occurs. The requirements depend on the card type and the region. For more information, refer to your agreement with your payment card company. You can get this type of information from the transaction details. The payer authentication transaction ID is listed in the transaction log. To access the transaction log, go to the Transaction Details page and in the Request Information section, click the View button. After your transactions are settled, you can also use this data to update the statistics of your business.

Searching for Payer Authentication Details {#pa-tranx-details-in-ebc-searching-pa-details}
==========================================================================================

Search the payer authentication data returned in API response fields with the Transaction Search feature in the `Business Center`.  
Interpret the result of an enrollment check using this color coding.

* If the application result appears in green, you do not need to authenticate the user. You can authorize the card immediately.
* If the application result appears in red, the authentication failed.
* If the application result appears in yellow, the transaction requires authentication.
  {#pa-tranx-details-in-ebc-searching-pa-details_ul_u3t_xh3_ypb}

Enrolling a Card {#pa-tranx-details-in-ebc-enrolled-cards}
==========================================================

Enrolling a card consists of two steps:

1. Checking for enrollment.
2. Authenticating the customer.
   {#pa-tranx-details-in-ebc-enrolled-cards_ul_xs3_k33_ypb}

Checking Enrollment {#pa-tranx-details-in-ebc-enrolled-cards-enrollment-check}
==============================================================================

You can find payer authentication data on the Transaction Details page in these sections:

* Request Information section: The enrollment check service is shown in red when the card is enrolled. You receive the corresponding response. If the card authorization service was requested at the same time, it did not run and appears in black.
* Order Information section: When authentication is required, American Express SafeKey requires that you save the XID for later use. You do not receive an ECI, AAV, or CAVV because the authentication is not complete.

{#pa-tranx-details-in-ebc-enrolled-cards-enrollment-check_ul_ysp_s33_ypb}  
If the CAVV and ECI are not provided, and the enrollment transaction results in a challenge, authentication is required.

Authentication Validation {#pa-tranx-details-in-ebc-enrolled-cards-auth-validation}
===================================================================================

When an authentication is valid and the card authorization succeeds, payer authentication data appears in the Transaction Search Details window in these sections:

* Request Information section: The validation service succeeded. A reason code 100 was returned with the corresponding response. The necessary payer authentication information was passed to the card authorization service, which processed successfully. Both services are shown in green.
* Order Information section: You received a value for all three parameters because the validation was successful. You might not receive an ECI value when a system error prevents the card issuer from performing the validation or when the cardholder does not complete the process.
  {#pa-tranx-details-in-ebc-enrolled-cards-auth-validation_ul_fd4_pj3_ypb}

Card Not Enrolled {#pa-tranx-details-in-ebc-card-not-enrolled}
==============================================================

When a card is not enrolled, the result of the enrollment check service appears in green, and the card authorization request (if requested at the same time) proceeds normally.

Transaction Details {#pa-tranx-details-in-ebc-card-not-enrolled-transx-details}
===============================================================================

Enter the payer authentication transaction ID into the quick search feature to find all segments of a transaction. For a transaction in which the card is not enrolled, find payer authentication data in the Transaction Details window in these sections:

Payer Authentication Reports {#concept_db3_ht3_ypb}
===================================================

This section describes the Payer Authentication reports that you can download from the `Business Center`.  
All reports on the production servers are retained for 16 months, but the transaction history is kept in the database for only 12 months. All reports on the test servers are deleted after 60 days. Only transactions that were processed are reported. Those transactions that resulted in a system error or a time-out are not reported.  
To get access to the reports, you must file a support ticket in the Support Center.

Interpreting the Report {#concept_o3d_lv3_ypb}
==============================================

The report is organized by card type. In each card type section, currencies are reported alphabetically. For each currency, a summary of your payer authentication validation results appear as a total amount and number of transactions.

[Payer Authentication Report Interpretation]

\* Although the report heading is 7, you receive a collection indicator value of 1, or the response field is empty.  
\*\* Although the report heading is Internet, you receive `spa_failure` in the commerce indicator response field.  
Transactions are divided into two groups: those for which you are protected and those for which you are not protected:

* For Relay,China UnionPay, Elo, JCB, Diners Club, Discover, and American Express: liability shift for VbV and VbV attempted.
* For Mastercard and Maestro: liability shift only for SPA.
* For all other results: no liability shift.

Comparing Payer Authentication and Payment Reports {#concept_h5x_2w3_ypb}
=========================================================================

The Payer Authentication report and the payment reports might differ when an authenticated transaction is not authorized.  
The values (amounts and counts) in the Payer Authentication report might not match your other sources of reconciliation. This report shows the transactions validated by payer authentication. A different number of transactions might have been authorized.  
The amounts and numbers can be higher in the Payer Authentication report than in the payment reports. This example shows the results of the first two numbers in the Payer Authentication report and the last number in the payment reports.  
To reconcile your reports more easily when using payer authentication, we recommend that you attempt to authenticate the same amount that you want to authorize.
Payer Authentication Reports Compared to Payment Reports
For 10,000 orders, you might receive these results:

* 9900 successful enrollment checks (Payer Authentication report)
* 9800 successful authentication checks (Payer Authentication report)
* 9500 successful authorization checks (Payment report)
