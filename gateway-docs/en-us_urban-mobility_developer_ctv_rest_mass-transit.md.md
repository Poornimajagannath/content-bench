Introduction to Card Present Connect \| Mass Transit {#um-intro-overview}
=========================================================================

Card Present Connect \| Mass Transit is the `Payment Gateway` solution for processing transactions using card scheme mass transit models. This solution follows global card scheme standards for contactless EMV transit transactions.

Transit Rider Benefits {#um-intro-rider}
========================================

These are some transit rider benefits:

* Retail-like contactless payment experience.
* Fast, contactless tap to enter and exit.
* Payment card data protection.
* Single, combined payment for multiple trips during a set period.
* Ability to request journey history and corresponding receipt.
* Travel fare total on payment card statements.
* Consistent fare collection experience across transit systems in various cities and countries.

Transit System Benefits {#um-intro-merchant}
============================================

These are some mass transit systems benefits:

* Lower ticketing overhead that can reduce the need for ticket booths or paper tickets.
* Ability to track riders when they tap to enter and exit.
* Flexible fare management, including:
  * Riders pay as they go.
  * Fares are aggregated for one payment transaction each travel period.
* Merchant protection such as:
  * Encrypted payment data.
  * First Ride Risk support in some regions.
* Debt recovery support.

Supported Card Types {#um-intro-supported-card-types}
=====================================================

The Mass Transit solution supports these card types. For more information, see [Mass Transit Models and Workflows](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-transit-models-flows-intro.md "").
* American Express
* Discover (US only)
* Mastercard
* Relay

Mass Transit Terminology {#um-intro-terms}
==========================================

Account Verification Request (AVR)
:
Zero amount authorization request that you send to determine whether the payment card is valid.

Aggregated
:
Transaction in which you calculate the fare based on multiple contactless card taps for trips during a predetermined time period, usually 24 hours, processed as a single transaction.

Back office
:
A component within your transit systems that processes the taps received from transit readers, and that performs any or all journey construction, fare calculation, risk management, and payment processing.

Card hash
:
One-way hash token ID of the payment card data that is used to maintain the deny list.

Combined data authentication (CDA)
:
Authentication technique that uses a combination of card and transaction data.

Deferred authorization
:
Combined authorization and capture request, also known as a sale, for aggregated fare payments.

Deny list
:
List of cards that failed ODA because of an unsuccessful AVR or transit payment. It is used for blocking cards that have not been accepted for travel within your transit system when you are processing aggregated payments, such as the Mastercard PAYG and Relay MTT models.

Deny list manager
:
Manages the deny list and distributes it to the validators.

First Ride Risk debt recovery
:
Under specific and limited conditions established by the card schemes, you can recover the cost of the first ride by capturing a declined authorization. For details, refer to each of the card scheme's rules for mass transit chargeback thresholds and protection. See [First Ride Risk](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-intro-overview/um-workflow-first-ride-risk.md "").

Instrument identifier token
:
`Token Management Service` token that stores the payment card number.

Journey construction
:
The process of analyzing individual taps received from transit readers and forming logical journeys performed by cardholders.

Mobility and Transport Transaction (MTT)
:
Relay model for contactless mass transit payments for single or multiple modes of transportation, which includes fixed, distance-based, and time-based fares.

Offline data authentication (ODA)
:
EMV security feature in which payment cards are authenticated offline. ODA is necessary so that cardholders can quickly tap and enter the transit system. It is used for aggregated transactions, such as Mastercard PAYG and Relay MTT.

Pay As You Go (PAYG) for Mastercard
:
Mastercard model in which the fare is not known when the cardholder taps their card for travel. All cardholder taps are recorded to calculate the fare and process an aggregated payment.

Payment instrument token
:
`Token Management Service` token that stores the instrument identifier token, card expiration date, and billing address.

Retail
:
Transaction in which you process the payment as a standard contactless retail payment.

Tap
:
Refers to the act of presenting a contactless card at a validator.

Ticket inspection
:
Process in which ticket inspectors verify compliance with fare policies by checking paper tickets or using a portable terminal to read the payment card.

Ticket inspectors
:
Transit employees who travel on the transit system to verify passenger travel status.

Transient token
:
Unique, time-limited token ID that is associated with the tokens created by TMS. The validator forwards this ID to your back office to use for payment transactions and to manage tokens. `Payment Gateway` automatically deletes this token after seven days.

Travel period
:
Period of time during which a traveler can make multiple taps in and out of the transit system, before you submit the final payment transaction for the aggregated amount.

Validator
:
EMV contactless card-present terminal located at an automated turnstile device where cardholders tap their card to enter, and optionally exit from, the transit system. Before allowing the cardholder to enter the transit system, the validator checks the deny list to ensure that the card has not failed ODA.

Mass Transit Prerequisites {#um-intro-reqs}
===========================================

Before integrating `Payment Gateway` services for mass transit, you must have these systems in place:

* Merchant account with an acquirer that is enabled for mass transit transactions on `Platform Connect`.
* `Payment Gateway` account for payment services.
* Payment technology provider (PTP) that is integrated with `Payment Gateway` and can perform message-level validation (MLV).
* EMV Level 1 certified transit terminals and EMV Level 2 certified software in preparation for EMV Level 3 Certification.

Mass Transit Validation and Certification {#um-intro-mlv-emvcert}
=================================================================

You must complete validation and certification activities before your system can go live. Work with your payment technology provider (PTP) to complete message-level validation (MLV) and EMV Level 3 certification of your transit fare processing system. You must pass MLV before beginning EMV Level 3 certification.

Message-Level Validation {#um-intro-mlv2}
=========================================

Message-level validation (MLV) is a script-based, field-level validation against `Payment Gateway` specifications.  
Your PTP uses amount-based test triggers to send transactions into a test environment and the Relay Certification Management System for decryption. The test results are XML or RESTful output, `Business Center` test transactions, and log prints.  
`Payment Gateway` uses these activities to validate the results:

* Cross edit checks
* Data element validation
* Interchange compliance
* Data mapping validation

EMV Level 3 Certification {#um-intro-emvl3-cert}
================================================

This section describes the Level 3 certification process used by `Payment Gateway` and `Platform Connect`. The certification processes and support for Global Card Present Connect projects and for direct merchant and acquirer projects differ from what is described here, but the timelines are basically the same.  
*Certification* is a formal process used to validate that the device and application are compliance with card scheme acceptance regulations. The certification team uses a brand test tool and simulator during the certification process, which includes these elements:

* A payment card simulation tool such as UL, ICC, or Fime.
* Failed case analysis and resolution.
* For Mastercard certification, your PTP submits results to Mastercard and pays the costs for approved partners that Mastercard uses.
* For Relay certification, `Payment Gateway` submits results to Relay.
* Waivers from the card schemes for exceptions.
* Card schemes responses or Letter of Approval (LOA) to signify acceptance and Level 3 certification.
  {#um-intro-emvl3-cert_ul_vq2_3tg_xtb}  
  For information about how to design an EMV Level 3 certified payment application, see [*EMV Book 3 Application Specification*](https://www.emvco.com/specifications/ "").

First Ride Risk {#um-workflow-first-ride-risk}
==============================================

First Ride Risk (FRR) is a feature that addresses the liability for the first use of a payment credential that fails pre-authorization and might result in a refusal for travel. Use FRR to capture a transaction even when the pre-authorization fails. In this case, the merchant or acquirer assumes responsibility for the risk.

First Ride Risk Eligibility Reason Codes {#um-workflow-first-ride-risk-codes}
=============================================================================

When a failed pre-authorization returns one of these response codes in the processorInformation.responseCode field, the transaction is eligible for FRR and capture:

* `01`: Refer to card issuers.
* `04`: Pick-up.
* `05`: ID certification fails.
* `12`: Invalid related transaction.
* `13`: Invalid amount.
* `14`: Invalid card number (no such account).
* `21`: Card not initialized.
* `22`: Suspected malfunction, related transaction error.
* `34`: Fraud.
* `38`: PIN try limit exceeded.
* `40`: Function requested not supported.
* `41`: Lost card.
* `43`: Stolen card.
* `57`: Transaction not allowed to be processed by cardholder.
* `58`: Transaction not allowed to be processed by terminal.
* `59`: Suspected fraud.
* `62`: Restricted card.
* `68`: Issuer response timeout.
* `75`: Allowable number of PIN tries exceeded.
* `90`: Cutoff is in progress.
* `91`: Issuer cannot process.
* `97`: ATM/POS terminal number cannot be located.
* `98`: Issuer response not received.
* `99`: PIN block error.
* `1A`: The transaction needs additional customer authentication.
* `A0`: MAC failed.
* `N1`: Items not on Bankbook beyond limit, declined.
* `P1`: Contact phone number of cardholder cannot be found in the issuer's system.

American Express Pay As You Go Workflow {#um-models-flows-amex-payg-flow}
=========================================================================

American Express PAYG is a delayed authorization model that uses the Expresspay transit policy workflow. It begins when the rider taps a payment card at the fare collection terminal.

#### Figure: {#um-models-flows-amex-payg-flow_fig_fqh_y5d_j3c}

Pay As You Go Delayed Authorization Model  
![Workflow diagram showing the American Express Pay As You Go Aggregated
transaction model.](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/mass-transit/images/transit-amex-flow-800x600.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The cardholder taps the card to enter the transit system.
2. The gate validates the card using offline data authentication (ODA), the card expiration date, and the deny list.
3. When the card is valid, the gate allows the passenger to enter the transit system.
4. When the ODA fails, the card is added to the deny list, and the debt recovery process begins. See [Debt Recovery Workflows](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-transit-models-flows-intro/um-models-flows-common-intro/um-models-flows-common-debt-recovery.md "").
5. You send an authorization request for a nominal amount. For authorization and capture options, see [American Express Authorization and Capture Options](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-transit-models-flows-intro/um-models-flows-amex-payg-intro/um-models-flows-amex-payg-auth-capture.md ""). Also see [American Express Delayed Online Authorization with EMV Data](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-processing-emv-vpc/um-processing-amex-auth-intro.md "").
6. When the authorization is successful, you calculate the fare for the travel period.
7. At the last tap of the day, submit a follow-on capture request for the day's aggregated fare amount.

American Express Authorization and Capture Options {#um-models-flows-amex-payg-auth-capture}
============================================================================================

There are two options for handling American Express PAYG authorizations and captures. Implement the option that suits your business model.

> IMPORTANT  
> American Express requires your payment technology partner (PTP) to support nominal and full value authorizations during the Level 3 certification.

1. Send an authorization request for a nominal amount.
2. During the travel period, collect the rider's tap data to calculate the aggregated fare.
3. Choose the request to send:
   * **Option 1:** When the floor limit is reached, send a capture request to collect the accumulated amount.
   * **Option 2:** When the number of trips exceeds the floor limit, send a delayed online authorization request.
4. After receiving a successful response, return to step 1 to handle subsequent trips and journeys.

Discover Pay As You Go Model {#um-models-flows-discover-payg-intro}
===================================================================

1. The cardholder taps the card to enter the transit system.
2. The gate validates the card using offline data authentication (ODA), the card expiration date, and the deny list.
3. When the card is valid, the gate allows the passenger to enter the transit system.
4. When the ODA fails, the card is added to the deny list, and the debt recovery process begins. See [Debt Recovery Workflows](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-transit-models-flows-intro/um-models-flows-common-intro/um-models-flows-common-debt-recovery.md "").
5. You send an authorization request for a nominal amount. See [Discover Authorization with EMV Data](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-processing-emv-vpc/um-processing-discover-auth-intro.md "").
6. When the authorization is successful, you calculate the fare for the travel period.
7. When the fare is more than 15.00 USD, an authorization or sale request for the higher amount is sent. See [Discover Sale with EMV Data](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-processing-emv-vpc/um-processing-sale-discover-intro.md "").
8. At the last tap of the day, a follow-on capture request for the day's aggregated fare amount is sent.

Discover Pay As You Go Aggregated Transactions {#um-models-flows-discover-aggregate}
====================================================================================

When the cardholder taps their Discover card in a transit system, initiate an aggregated transaction by requesting an authorization for 1.00 USD that includes the processingInformation.authorizationOptions.aggregatedAuthIndicator field set to `true`.  
If the issuer approves the authorization, subsequent taps do not require an authorization. The capture amount must not exceed 15.00 USD in the US, and the capture date must not exceed the aggregation duration of up to 14 days from the first tap transaction.  
If the aggregate total nears the maximum aggregation amount, and the next tap will cause the aggregation amount to exceed 15.00 USD, capture the existing aggregate total. Then, authorize the current tap for 1.00 USD to begin a new aggregation cycle, and include the processingInformation.authorizationOptions.aggregatedAuthIndicator field set to `true`.  
For more information about Discover aggregated transactions, see the *Discover Global Network Contactless D-PAS: Open Loop Transit Implementation Guide*.

1. The cardholder taps the card to enter the transit system.
2. The validator checks the deny list to determine card validity, and allows the rider to enter the transit system.
3. The back office submits an account verification request (AVR) to `Payment Gateway`. See [Relay Account Verification Request with EMV Data](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-processing-emv-vpc/um-processing-relay-avr-intro.md "").
4. When the authorization fails, the card is added to the deny list, and the debt recovery process begins.

Common Mass Transit Transaction Workflows and Features {#um-models-flows-common-intro}
======================================================================================

This section describes mass transit transaction workflows and features that are common across supported card schemes.

Aggregated Fare Transaction Workflow {#um-transit-models-flows-aggregated}
==========================================================================

This section describes the Aggregated Fare transactions workflow. In this workflow, the final transit fare is not always known at the time of travel. It is calculated at the end of a travel period, typically 24 hours, based on the journeys made during that period and any applicable fare limits. An *aggregated transaction* is used on contactless terminals at transit system access points to support fare calculation after the travel period has ended.

#### Figure: {#um-transit-models-flows-aggregated_fig_q2r_wmd_j3c}

Aggregated Fare Transaction Workflow  
![Diagram showing aggregated fare transaction workflow](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/mass-transit/images/aggregated-transaction-flow-480x520.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Aggregated Model with the `Token Management Service` {#um-models-flows-aggregated-tms-ctv-intro}
================================================================================================

Using tokens can reduce the amount of cardholder information that your systems store, process, or transmit. This approach can simplify your Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance efforts for maintaining a secure payment processing environment.  
When you integrate aggregated acceptance models with the `Token Management Service` (`TMS`), `TMS` tokenizes, stores, and manages customer and payment data. You store these tokens in your environment instead of customer payment details.  
Use `TMS` to store these types of data:

* EMV track 2 equivalent
* EMV tag-length-value (TLV) string of tags for use during payment authorization
* Card number (`TMS` instrument identifier)
* Card hash value (used within deny list management systems)  
  `TMS` uses a cryptographic base derivation key (BDK) to create tokens that represent the customer and payment data. You store these tokens in your environment and databases instead of customer payment details.

Aggregated Model with the `Token Management Service` Workflow {#um-models-flows-aggregated-tms-ctv-workflow}
============================================================================================================

The Aggregated Model with `TMS` workflow begins when the rider taps a payment card at a fare collection reader (terminal) in the transit system.

This process begins when the rider taps their card at the validator.

1. Rider taps card at the validator.
2. The terminal uses the Level 3 payment application to generate a card hash and checks the deny list for the card hash.
3. When the card hash is on the deny list, the card is not approved for travel and the terminal does not open the gate.
4. When the card hash is not on the deny list, the card is approved for travel and the terminal opens the gate and begins the account verification request (AVR) process.
5. The rider performs additional taps as required by the transit system during the travel period.

AVR Process with `TMS`
----------------------

This process begins when the validator sends the transient token data to the back office.

1. The validator sends this tap data to `TMS` to tokenize the data:
   * Transient token, in the ID field
   * Card hash
   * Fluid data descriptor, encoding, and value
2. `TMS` creates tokens of the tap data and stores the card hash with the tokens.
3. The back office performs a verification request as required by the card scheme transit model.
4. The back office uses the transient token ID for these requests:
   * Retrieving the token IDs for debt recovery and BIN lookup requests
   * Performing an AVR, deferred authorization, and follow-on transactions

End of Travel Period Process with `TMS`
---------------------------------------

This process begins at the end of the travel period.

1. At the end of the travel period, the back office calculates the fare and sends a deferred authorization, which can be a combined authorization and capture, using the transient token ID in place of the card data.
2. If the authorization fails, the back office retrieves the card hash from `TMS`, adds the card hash to the deny list, and begins the debt recovery process.

Debt Recovery Process with `TMS`
--------------------------------

This process begins when your back office requests debt recovery.

1. In accordance with the relevant card scheme rule set, the back office requests a merchant-initiated debt recovery using the instrument identifier token ID in place of a card number.
2. When debt recovery is successful, the back office uses the card hash token to retrieve the full card hash value.
3. The back office removes the card hashes from the deny list.
4. When the debt recovery fails, the associated card hashes stay on the deny list.

Near Real-Time Workflow {#um-models-flows-common-denylist}
==========================================================

The near real-time workflow begins when the cardholder taps a payment card at the validator to enter the transit system.

#### Figure:

Near Real-Time Workflow  
![Diagram showing Near Real-Time workflow](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/mass-transit/images/near-real-time-workflow-550x415.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The validator checks the deny list for the payment card.
2. When the card is on the deny list due to a previous failed payment, the validator does not open the gate, and the payment is processed through a debt recovery workflow. See the [Debt Recovery Workflows](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-transit-models-flows-intro/um-models-flows-common-intro/um-models-flows-common-debt-recovery.md "").
3. When the card is not on the deny list, the validator opens the transit gate for the cardholder to travel.
4. A new transient token is generated for processing the account verification request (AVR).
5. The back office sends an account verification request (AVR) to `Payment Gateway`.
6. When the AVR fails, the card is added to the deny list and might be eligible for the first ride risk debt recovery.
7. When the AVR is successful, the card data is used to track subsequent taps, calculate fares for the day, and capture the deferred authorization.

Fare Calculation and Submission Workflow {#um-models-flows-common-fare-calc}
============================================================================

The fare calculation workflow begins at the end of the travel period.

#### Figure:

Relay Fare Calculation and Submission Workflow  
![Diagram showing Relay Fare Calculation and Submission Workflow](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/mass-transit/images/fare-calculation-submision-workflow-430x600.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The back office calculates the fare of all rides taken during the travel period.
2. You request a sale transaction for the accumulated fare. See [Relay Deferred Sale with EMV Data](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-processing-emv-vpc/um-processing-sale-deferred-intro.md "").
3. When the sale is successful, the process is complete.
4. When the sale is declined, the card hash is added to the deny list.
5. When the declined sale amount is above the chargeback threshold, the transaction is moved to debt recovery. See [Debt Recovery Workflows](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-transit-models-flows-intro/um-models-flows-common-intro/um-models-flows-common-debt-recovery.md "").
6. When the declined sale amount is for a first ride and below the chargeback threshold, you can request the payment using the first ride risk chargeback rules as defined by each card scheme.
   {#um-models-flows-common-fare-calc_ol_cvj_rjw_7tb}

Debt Recovery Workflows {#um-models-flows-common-debt-recovery}
===============================================================

Debt recovery workflows show how to use debt recovery transactions to collect outstanding debt when an aggregated end-of-day transaction is declined.  
Card schemes require merchants to support merchant-initiated debt recovery. This type of transaction can also be required to remove a card from a deny list. Each card scheme has its own transaction-processing rules for debt recovery retry attempts, transaction time limits, and related mass transit transactions. For more information, see each card scheme's rules for transit debt recovery retry attempts and transaction time limits.
IMPORTANT Use a debt recovery transaction to remove a card from a deny list. This action must be completed within one hour of receiving the authorization approval.  
These debt recovery transactions are supported:

* A merchant-initiated transaction that uses the card number.
* A tap-initiated transaction that uses the EMV track 2 equivalent and EMV tags created when the cardholder re-enters the transit system.
* A cardholder-initiated transaction that the customer requests by contacting you.

{#um-models-flows-common-debt-recovery_ul_kxv_bsd_xhc}  
When a debt recovery transaction is declined, you can request payment using the First Ride Risk liability model. For more information, see each card scheme's rules for mass transit transaction chargebacks.

Merchant-Initiated Debt Recovery
--------------------------------

A *merchant-initiated* (MIT) *debt recovery* transaction is a deferred authorization that originates from your back office. This type of transaction is also called *auto-debt recovery*. The authorization resubmission typically uses the card number and references the original, end-of-day transaction that was declined. Relay allows up to six authorization resubmissions within 14 days.

#### Figure: {#um-models-flows-common-debt-recovery_fig_glc_2d2_j3c}

Relay Merchant-Initiated Debt Recovery Workflow  
![Diagram showing Relay's Merchant-Initiated Debt Recovery workflow](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/mass-transit/images/merchant-init-debt-recovery-flow-475x345.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. When the number of retry attempts for the MIT debt recovery transaction exceeds the card scheme's limit, stop further processing and keep the card on the deny list.
2. When the amount is below the debt recovery amount limit, send a sale request. See [Merchant-Initiated Sale for Relay Debt Recovery with Stored Card Data](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-processing-emv-vpc/um-processing-sale-mit-intro.md "").
3. When the transaction is declined, keep the card on the deny list.
4. When the transaction is successful, remove the card from the deny list.

Scheduled Debt Recovery Transaction Resubmission
------------------------------------------------

A *scheduled debt recovery* transaction is a system-generated transaction that originates from your back office. This transaction typically uses the card number and references the original, end-of-day transaction that was declined. Multiple authorization resubmissions might be triggered within 14 days.

#### Figure: {#um-models-flows-common-debt-recovery_fig_ibv_nh1_zhc}

Scheduled Debt Recovery Workflow ![Workflow diagram showing Scheduled Debt Recovery workflow](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/mass-transit/images/system-gen-debt-recovery-flow-600x345.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. You configure your payment system to generate scheduled debt recovery authorization requests.
2. The scheduled authorizations attempt debt recovery submissions within 14 days of the initial transaction.
3. When the number of retry attempts for the scheduled debt transaction exceeds the card scheme's limit, stop further processing and keep the card on the deny list.
4. When the amount is below the debt recovery amount limit, send a sale request.
5. When the transaction is declined, keep the card on the deny list.
6. When the transaction is successful, remove the card from the deny list.

Tap-Initiated Debt Recovery
---------------------------

A *tap-initiated debt recovery* transaction occurs when the cardholder returns to the transit gate, and the validator recognizes a new contactless tap.  
You can deny the rider entrance unless the tap-initiated debt recovery transaction is attempted in real time while the cardholder is at the gate. The authorization request includes the EMV track 2 equivalent and EMV tags from the new tap, and a future capture date.

#### Figure: {#um-models-flows-common-debt-recovery_fig_xpp_lr3_k3c}

Tap-Initiated Debt Recovery Workflow  
![Diagram showing Tap-Initiated Debt Recovery Workflow](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/mass-transit/images/tap-initiated-debt-recovery-flow-260x425.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The cardholder taps their card to enter the transit system.
2. You submit a new authorization request using the EMV track 2 equivalent and EMV tags created by the validator and a capture date in the future.
3. When the transaction is declined, keep the card on the deny list.
4. When the transaction is successful, remove the card from the deny list.

Cardholder-Initiated Debt Recovery
----------------------------------

A *cardholder-initiated debt recovery* transaction occurs when the cardholder contacts you. The method of contact depends on where the transaction occurred such as on your e-commerce website or by phone or email for a mail order or telephone order (MOTO) transaction.  
For information about e-commerce or MOTO payment services, see the [*Payments Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-intro.md "").

1. The cardholder contacts you through your website or by phone or email for a MOTO transaction.
2. You process a card-not-present (CNP) authorization.
3. When the request is successful, remove the card from the deny list.
4. When the request fails, leave the card on the deny list.

Using Multiple Accounts for Processing Functions {#um-models-flows-mult-accts}
==============================================================================

Mass transit systems can use multiple accounts to support a variety of processing functions. Processing functions include these types of tasks:

* Creating tap tokens
* Processing payment requests
* Retrieving card hash values
* Supporting customer journey history inquiries
  Each processing function is handled by a separate account to improve security, isolation, and operational clarity. These accounts are available in the Mass Transit solution:

Account 1
:
This account processes tap token create requests only. For this option, the validators communicate directly with `Payment Gateway`. Using a separate account enables you to deploy a separate security key to the validator system.

Account 2
:
This account processes payment requests using tokens. You can also choose to further separate debt recovery transactions from standard payment transactions. In that case, account 2a is dedicated to standard payment transactions, and account 2b is dedicated to debt recovery transactions.

Account 3
:
This account processes card hash retrieval requests only. The responses include the full, unmasked card hash value. Using a separate account enables you to deploy a separate security key to the validator system.

Account 4
:
This account operates a customer service web portal where riders can make journey history inquiries. The riders provide the card number to a hosted payment service (such as `Payment Gateway` Secure Acceptance) where they register as a user. Registration produces the `TMS` instrument identifier token and the card scheme PAR value. These values can be used by your back-office system to look up journey and billing information.

Journey History Service {#um-models-flows-journey-hist-intro}
=============================================================

Card schemes might require transit operators to provide cardholders with a journey history service that enables the cardholder to view their journey history and receipt information. Refer to card scheme documentation for more information about each card scheme's requirements for journey history.

Payment Account Reference
-------------------------

`Payment Gateway` supports the use of the payment account reference (PAR) by providing the PAR value in authorization responses when a PAR is available from the card issuer. The PAR response field is processorInformation.paymentAccountReferenceNumber. Using the PAR enables you to track card accounts when digital devices, such as smart phones and smart watches, have a network token or DPAN that the card issuer provided to the device. You can use the PAR to provide journey history to cardholders and to match the card account FPAN and DPAN values.

Merchant Descriptor
-------------------

You can use the merchant descriptor feature to produce a transaction-specific reference that cardholders can see on their card account statement. To use the merchant descriptor feature, include the merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.name field in your authorization, credit, and capture requests. The value for the field must consist solely of English characters.

> IMPORTANT  
> Before implementing transit journey history functionality, confirm with your acquirer and card schemes that the PAR and merchant descriptor features are supported.

Additional Information
----------------------

For information about the `Payment Gateway` card-not-present services that support a transit system's journey history service, see the [*Payments Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-intro.md "").

Journey History Service Workflow {#um-models-flows-journey-hist-flow}
=====================================================================

The Journey History Service workflow begins when begins when the rider taps a payment card at a fare collection terminal. This service enables the cardholder to view their journey history and receipt information. See card scheme documentation for more information about each scheme's journey history requirements.

Mass Transit Payment Services Using EMV and Card Data {#um-processing-emv-vpc}
==============================================================================

You can request these payment services for mass transit with EMV and card data:

* Authorization for account verification and debt recovery.
* Sale for aggregated fares and debt recovery.
* Stand-alone credit.  
  The EMV Data Elements and Tags table lists details about EMV tags that are mandatory (M), prohibited (P), optional (O), or conditional (C) for the processor. Send a conditional tag when it is present in the card and terminal.

Mass Transit Transaction Types {#um-processing-trxn-types}
==========================================================

This section describes mass transit transaction types and related field values. When you include the transaction type in your mass transit request, it appears in the `Business Center` and on transaction reports.  
To include the transaction type in your request, set the clientReferenceInformation.comments request field to the transaction value that corresponds to the service category.  
These are transactions type categories:

TransitDA
:
Use this category for transit deferred-aggregated (DA) transactions. These transactions are also called *Relay MTT* and *Mastercard PAYG* transactions.

BAU
:
Use this category for business-as-usual (BAU) transactions that represent no exceptions or errors for cardholders.

FRR
:
Use this category for first-ride-risk (FRR) transactions that occur where the First Ride Risk liability shift is used. These transactions are specific to a card scheme and region.

DR
:
Use this category for debt-recovery (DR) transactions initiated by the merchant or when the cardholder taps a contactless card at a validator to enter the transit system.

DR CIT
:
Use this category for debt-recovery (DR) customer-initiated transactions (CIT) that are initiated by the cardholder when they explicitly pay a debt, including e-commerce and telephone orders.

Service
:
Use this category for standard transactions when completing payment transactions.

Error
:
Use this category for standard transactions when handling transaction errors.
{#um-processing-trxn-types_ul_o4h_k34_syb}  
These tables list the field values for the payment services supported by each transaction type.

Mastercard Authorization with EMV Data {#um-processing-mc-auth-intro}
=====================================================================

Use this information to process a Mastercard authorization with EMV data for a nominal amount.

Response Field Handling
-----------------------

When you receive the `AUTH_DECLINE_CAPTURE_POSSIBLE` value in the errorInformation.reason field of an authorization response, it indicates that a capture attempt will not be rejected automatically. Before processing the capture, verify that it is permitted in this scenario by reviewing the card scheme's First Ride Risk and shared‑liability rules.  
For an example of the field data, see the response in [REST Example: Relay Deferred Sale with EMV Data](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-processing-emv-vpc/um-processing-sale-deferred-intro/um-processing-sale-deferred-ex-rest.md ""). For more information about the field, see the [errorInformation.reason](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/api-fields/reference/all/rest/api-fields/error-info-aa/error-info-reason.md "") field description.

Relay Deferred Sale with EMV Data {#um-processing-sale-deferred-intro}
=====================================================================

Use this information to process a deferred sale transaction at the end of the travel period for an aggregated payment.

Response Field Handling
-----------------------

When you receive the `AUTH_DECLINE_CAPTURE_POSSIBLE` value in the errorInformation.reason field of an authorization response, it indicates that a capture attempt will not be rejected automatically. Before processing the capture, verify that it is permitted in this scenario by reviewing the card scheme's First Ride Risk and shared‑liability rules.  
For an example of the field data, see the response in [REST Example: Relay Deferred Sale with EMV Data](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-processing-emv-vpc/um-processing-sale-deferred-intro/um-processing-sale-deferred-ex-rest.md ""). For more information about the field, see the [errorInformation.reason](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/api-fields/reference/all/rest/api-fields/error-info-aa/error-info-reason.md "") field description.

Mass Transit Payment Services Using TMS Tokens {#um-processing-tms}
===================================================================

Use TMS tokens to request these mass transit payment services:

* Authorization for account verification and debt recovery

* Sale for aggregated fares and debt recovery

* Stand-alone credit  
  In card-present EMV contactless requests, include the transient token ID in the tokenInformation.jti field in place of track 2 data.  
  When submitting a tap token creation request, you can include EMV tag-length-value (TLV) tags in the paymentInformation.fluidData.value field or as part of the payment transaction request within the pointOfSaleInformation.emv.tags field.  
  If you send EMV tags in the tap token create request, do not send EMV tags in the payment transaction request.  
  When EMV TLV tags are present in both the payment transaction and the token vault, `Payment Gateway` reads the value provided in the payment transaction rather than the values stored in the vault.  
  Mastercard EMV transactions include these three field values, which can be handled automatically:

* paymentInformation.card.initiationChannel

* pointOfSaleInformation.emv.cardSequenceNumber

* pointOfSaleInformation.serviceCode  
  Your account can be configured to read these values automatically from the EMV TLV tags and track 2 equivalent. When that option is enabled, do not include those three fields in EMV payment requests.  
  If any of these values are present in both the separate fields and the EMV TLV and track 2 equivalent, `Payment Gateway` reads the value provided in the separate fields rather than the values present in the EMV TLV and track 2 equivalent.

Tap-Initiated Sale for Debt Recovery with a Token {#um-processing-sale-debtrecov-tkn-intro}
===========================================================================================

Use this information to process a tap-initiated sale for debt recovery with a token.  
A sale transaction combines an authorization and capture. When a cardholder attempts to use a blocked card at the transit reader, create a fresh debt recovery sale request using the chip data from the new tap, along with the fare amount of the previous declined authorization.

Stand-Alone Credit with a Token {#um-processing-credit-intro}
=============================================================

Use this information to process a stand-alone credit with a token.  
A *stand-alone credit* is a credit that is not linked to a previous transaction. When you process a stand-alone credit, there is no set limit on the amount because there is no reference to the original transaction amount. There is no time limit for requesting a stand-alone credit.
IMPORTANT Restrict access to the stand-alone credit service and do not make it available directly on your customer-facing interface. Instead, include the feature in your internal customer-service process to prevent misuse and make sure all requests are reviewed.  
When a stand-alone credit request is successful, the issuing bank for the payment card takes money out of the merchant bank account and returns it to the customer. It typically takes two to four days for the acquiring bank to transfer funds from the merchant bank account.

Mass Transit Token Management Services {#um-processing-token-intro}
===================================================================

Use the `Token Management Service` to create, retrieve, and delete tokens for mass transit.

Creating a Token {#um-processing-token-create-intro}
====================================================

Use this information to create tokens directly from the validator or through your back office system.  
When the customer taps their card, the validator generates a unique transaction identifier that is used to create these tokens:

* Transient token: tokenized EMV tag data and track2 data. Used as the transaction ID to create the instrument identifier and payment instrument tokens, and as the payment token for the final authorization and sale transactions. You can delete this token after a success transit payment for the travel period. `Payment Gateway` stores this token for 7 days.
* Instrument identifier: tokenized card number, used for follow-on payment transactions and BIN lookup.
* Payment instrument: stores the card hash that is used to identify the payment card in the deny list.

Creating a Token Workflow  
![Diagram showing the Creating a Token workflow](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/mass-transit/images/mtt-create-token-390x430.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
The token creation process begins when the when the cardholder taps a payment card at the fare collection terminal.

1. The cardholder taps their contactless card.
2. Regular local transit processing occurs. See [Mass Transit Models and Workflows](/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-transit-models-flows-intro.md "").
3. The validator encrypts the card data and creates the card hash value.
4. Your system uses the card hash value to create the tokens.
5. You receive the tokens in the response message.
