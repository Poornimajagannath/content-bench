Introduction to PayPal and Venmo {#paypal-intro}
================================================

PayPal and Venmo are two payment methods that you can offer your customers through Payment Gateway. When your customers check out on your website, they can choose to pay with PayPal or Venmo, and then use their PayPal or Venmo account to complete the purchase. PayPal also offers installant payments known as PayPal Pay Later.

Benefits
--------

Integrating PayPal or Venmo into your system gives you and your customers these payment options.

**PayPal**
:
PayPal is a secure and convenient payment service. Your customers can make payments without directly using their bank accounts or credit cards.

**Venmo (US only)**
:
Venmo is a mobile payment service owned by PayPal that enables your customers to make payments from their Venmo mobile app. Customers link their Venmo accounts to their bank accounts, debit cards, and credit cards to send and receive payments.

    > IMPORTANT  
    > Venmo requires that you integrate a JavaScript SDK into your checkout experience.  
    > For more information about how to integrate the SDK into your website, see the Pay with Venmo integration section and the JavaScript SDK reference section on the PayPal developer website:
    >
    > * **Pay with Venmo integration:** ` `<https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/pay-with-venmo/integrate/#link-Pay%20with%20Venmo%20integration>` `
    > * **JavaScript SDK reference:** [` https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/reference/ `](https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/reference/ "")

**PayPal Pay Later**
:
With PayPal, customers can pay in installments, but merchants receive full payment immediately.

    * **Pay in 3:** Customer pays in three installments. Available in the UK.
    * **Pay in 4:** Customers pay in four installments. Available in the US.
    * **Pay Monthly:** Customers pay in monthly recurring installments.

Getting Started with REST
-------------------------

To begin processing payments through `Payment Gateway`, you must first set up your payment processing system to be REST compliant. `Payment Gateway` uses the REST architecture for developing web services. REST enables communication between a client and server using HTTP protocols.  
If you have not set up secure communications between your client and server using either a **JSON Web Token** or **HTTP signature** , see the [*Getting Started with REST Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-intro.md "").

Set Up Merchant Accounts {#paypal-intro-setup}
==============================================

Before you can process payments with PayPal, you must acquire PayPal merchant credentials. Complete these steps to obtain the credentials and to link your PayPal merchant account with your `Payment Gateway` merchant account:
1. Set up a PayPal business or premier account:  
   <https://www.paypal.com/us/business>
2. Set up a PayPal developer sandbox account.
   3. Create your PayPal credentials by creating a PayPal app as directed on the PayPal developer website:  
      <https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/#get-credentials>
3. Save the sandbox account facilitator email address, the client ID, and the secret key for future reference.  
   For example:
   * Sandbox account facilitator email address:  
     `merchantuser-facilitator@merchant.com`
   * Client ID:  
     `AahnQzKLL2vvG_UI6YQy9xcyt5joMLVoPHW-1Bv8gCvPkTiNwQSRCvKIKXy8UZZguijbwJTTs_Cjhdz`
   * Secret key:  
     `EOE3eqqeIBy4q8LhsON0-wp2zPb_0SOqPH3sopx_uwuIMkCug7zw3aKDunstrXmcrGecmpeUJgsqTGO`
4. Contact `Payment Gateway` merchant support and provide your PayPal credentials:
   * Sandbox account facilitator email address
   * Client ID

* Secret key  
  When your account is set up, you can begin processing PayPal or Venmo payments.

Overview of Processing PayPal Transactions {#paypal-intro-overview}
===================================================================

PayPal requires you to create an order before processing a payment. After creating an order, you can process the payment using the authorization and capture API requests, or the sale API request. This section describes the steps required in order to create and manage orders and to process transactions.

Requests and Endpoints
----------------------

These are the requests you can send to `Payment Gateway` to process PayPal transactions and their corresponding endpoints.

Order Management Requests {#paypal-services-order}
==================================================

This section describes how to manage orders using the `REST API`.

Create a PayPal Order {#paypal-create-order-intro}
==================================================

This section describes how to create a *PayPal* order.  
You must send a create order request to begin processing a new payment. Creating an order enables the customer to complete checkout using their PayPal account.

**Itemization**
:
Every unique item being purchased must be itemized in the request as a line item. For more information about how to format line items in a request, see [Including Line Items in Requests](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-ref-info/paypal-create-order-line-items.md "").

Payment Processing Type
:
You must also set the processingInformation.authorizationOptions.authType request field to `AUTHORIZE` or `CAPTURE` to indicate which follow-on requests you will send to process the payment. Set the field value to `AUTHORIZE` if you want to process the payment using the authorization and capture requests. Set the field value to `CAPTURE` if you want to process the payment using the sale request.

Payment Method
:
To specify that the customer is paying with PayPal, set the paymentInformation.paymentType.method.name request field to `payPal`.

Saving Payment Credentials
:
You can save a customer's payment credentials in order to make future transactions fast and simple for the customer. To save the customer's credentials, you must include the optional processingInformation.processingInstruction request field and set its value to `ORDER_SAVED_EXPLICITLY`. After you successfully create the order and the customer completes the checkout, you must send a follow-on save payment credentials request. For more information, see [Save an Order](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services-order/paypal-save-order-intro.md "").  
A successful request is indicated by a PayPal redirect URL in the processorInformation.paymentUrl response field and a request ID in the id response field. Redirect the customer to the PayPal URL where they can log in to their PayPal account to approve and complete the payment. Save the request ID in your system for the follow-on API requests.

Response Statuses for Creating a PayPal Order {#paypal-create-order-resp-fields}
================================================================================

`Payment Gateway` responds to your request with one of these statuses in the status field:
* `PAYER_ACTION_REQUIRE`: The request was successful, and you must redirect the customer to the PayPal checkout URL in order for the customer to approve the payment.{#paypal-create-order-resp-fields_payer-action-req}
  {#paypal-create-order-resp-fields_payer-action-req}
* `INVALID_REQUEST`: The request was not successful. Send a new request.{#paypal-create-order-resp-fields_status-failed}
  {#paypal-create-order-resp-fields_status-failed} {#paypal-create-order-resp-fields_statuses-create-order}  
  When you request a status update, `Payment Gateway` responds with one of these statuses in the status field:
* `COMPLETED`: The order was approved by the customer. This status can also occur when the order is successfully used for an authorization or sale.{#paypal-create-order-resp-fields_status-4}
  {#paypal-create-order-resp-fields_status-4}

Follow-On Requests {#paypal-create-order-resp-fields_follow-on-req}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

After you create an order, you can send these follow-on API requests using the order ID from the response message.

Update Order
:
To update the order information, such as the payment amount or line items, send an update order request. For more information, see [Update an Order](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services-order/paypal-update-order-intro.md "").

Save Order
:
To save the customer's payment credentials in the order to make future check out experiences faster for the customer, send a save order request. For more information, see [Save an Order](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services-order/paypal-save-order-intro.md "").

Authorization
:
To authorize funds for a payment, send an authorization request. For more information, see [Authorize a Payment](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services/paypal-auth-intro.md "").

Sale
:
To authorize and capture funds for a payment in the same request, send a sale request. For more information, see [Process a Sale](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services/paypal-sale-intro.md "").

Create a Venmo Order {#concept}
===============================

This section describes how to create a *Venmo* order.  
You must send a create order request to begin processing a new payment. Creating an order enables the customer to complete checkout using their Venmo account.

**Itemization**
:
Every unique item being purchased must be itemized in the request as a line item. For more information about how to format line items in a request, see [Including Line Items in Requests](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-ref-info/paypal-create-order-line-items.md "").

Payment Processing Type
:
You must also set the processingInformation.authorizationOptions.authType request field to `AUTHORIZE` or `CAPTURE` to indicate which follow-on requests you will send to process the payment. Set the field value to `AUTHORIZE` if you want to process the payment using the authorization and capture requests. Set the field value to `CAPTURE` if you want to process the payment using the sale request.

Payment Method
:
To specify that the customer is paying with Venmo, set the paymentInformation.paymentType.method.name request field to `Venmo`.

Saving Payment Credentials
:
You can save a customer's payment credentials in order to make future transactions fast and simple for the customer. To save the customer's credentials, you must include the optional processingInformation.processingInstruction request field and set its value to `ORDER_SAVED_EXPLICITLY`. After you successfully create the order and the customer completes the checkout, you must send a follow-on save payment credentials request. For more information, see [Save an Order](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services-order/paypal-save-order-intro.md "").  
A successful request is indicated by a Venmo transaction ID in the processorInformation.transactionId response field and a request ID in the id response field. Your system should set the transaction ID in the SDK to automatically create a Venmo checkout button on your checkout webpage. When the customer clicks the Venmo button, a QR displays to the customer. Your customer uses their Venmo mobile app to scan the QR code and complete the checkout using their Venmo mobile app. Save the request ID in your system for the follow-on API requests.

Follow-On Requests
------------------

After you create an order, you can send these follow-on API requests using the order ID from the response message.

Update Order
:
To update the order information, such as the payment amount or line items, send an update order request. For more information, see [Update an Order](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services-order/paypal-update-order-intro.md "").

Save Order
:
To save the customer's payment credentials in the order to make future check out experiences faster for the customer, send a save order request. For more information, see [Save an Order](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services-order/paypal-save-order-intro.md "").

Authorization
:
To authorize funds for a payment, send an authorization request. For more information, see [Authorize a Payment](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services/paypal-auth-intro.md "").

Sale
:
To authorize and capture funds for a payment in the same request, send a sale request. For more information, see [Process a Sale](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services/paypal-sale-intro.md "").

Update an Order {#paypal-update-order-intro}
============================================

You can update the information in an order, such as the payment details and line items, by requesting an update order. Updating an order is necessary when a customer decides to change their purchase, billing, or shipping information, and when inventory adjustments occur.  
Include all of the customer's information sent in the create order request in the update order request to ensure the order's accuracy. Only exclude fields that relate to information you are intentionally removing from an order.

> IMPORTANT You cannot update an order after an authorization or sale is complete.

Response Statuses for Updating an Order {#paypal-update-order-resp-fields}
==========================================================================

`Payment Gateway` responds to your request with one of these statuses in the status field:
* `COMPLETED`: The request was successful and the order information is updated.{#paypal-update-order-resp-fields_status-1}
  {#paypal-update-order-resp-fields_status-1}
* `INVALID_REQUEST`: The request was not successful. Send a new update order request.{#paypal-update-order-resp-fields_status-2}
  {#paypal-update-order-resp-fields_status-2} {#paypal-update-order-resp-fields_update-order-statuses}

Save an Order {#paypal-save-order-intro}
========================================

After the customer completes the purchase using the Paypal or Venmo redirect URL from the create order response, you can save the customer's order by requesting a save order. Saving a customer's order enables you to retain an order even after you have authorized the payment. This is necessary for situations where you must reverse the authorization but plan to authorize the same order again. When the order is authorized and captured, you can longer authorize the saved order.  
If you decide that you no longer need to retain a saved order, you can cancel the saved order by sending a void order request. For more information, see [Void an Order](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services-order/paypal-void-order-intro.md "").  
IMPORTANT The customer must give you consent to saving their payment credentials in an order before you save their information.

Prerequisite
:
Before sending the save order request, you must ensure that the create order request included the processingInformation.processingInstruction field set to the `ORDER_SAVED_EXPLICITLY` value.

Response Statuses for Checking Status {#paypal-status-order-resp-status}
========================================================================

`Payment Gateway` responds to your request with one of these statuses in the status response field. The possible statuses are dependent on the API service you are retrieving a status for.

Create Order
:
* `COMPLETED`: The order was approved by the customer. This status can also occur when the order is successfully used for an authorization or sale.
* `PAYER_ACTION_REQUIRE`: The request was successful, and you must redirect the customer to the PayPal checkout URL in order for the customer to approve the payment.
* `INVALID_REQUEST`: The request was not successful. Send a new request.

Update Order
:
* `COMPLETED`: The request was successful and the order information is updated.
* `INVALID_REQUEST`: The request was not successful. Send a new update order request.

Save Order
:
* `COMPLETED`: The request was successful and the customer's payment information from the order is saved for future transactions.
* `INVALID_REQUEST`: The request was not successful. Send a new save order request.

Void Order
:
* `VOIDED`: The request was successful and the customer's payment credentials are no longer saved.
* `INVALID_REQUEST`: The request was not successful. Send a new request.

Payment Processing Requests {#paypal-services}
==============================================

This section describes how to process a payment using the `REST API`.

Authorize a Payment {#paypal-auth-intro}
========================================

You must request an authorization to secure funds for a payment. Include the request ID that you received in the create order response in the processingInformation.intentsId request field to link the authorization to the created order.  
Successfully authorized funds expire after 29 days. If the funds are not captured within 3 days of the authorization, you must request Re-authorization to maintain the honor period. The *honor period* is a 3-day period in which PayPal accepts the capture request that a merchant submits. If the 3-day honor period expires because you did not send a re-authorization request, PayPal contacts the card's issuer to re-authorize the payment. For more information, see [Re-authorize a PayPal Payment](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services/paypal-reauth-intro.md "").  
The `PENDING` status and a request ID in the id response field indicate a successful request. Save the request ID for follow-on requests.

* `INVALID_REQUEST`: The authorization request was not successful. Send a new authorization request.{#paypal-auth-resp-status_status-2}
  {#paypal-auth-resp-status_status-2}
* `PENDING`: The authorization request was successful, and PayPal is reviewing the request. Use the check status request as often as necessary until the status updates.{#paypal-auth-resp-status_status-1}
  {#paypal-auth-resp-status_status-1}

When you request a status update, `Payment Gateway` responds with one of these statuses in the status response field:

* `COMPLETED`: The authorized funds were successfully captured.{#paypal-auth-resp-status_status-3}
  {#paypal-auth-resp-status_status-3}
* `PENDING`: The authorization request was successful, and PayPal is reviewing the request. Continue to send periodic check status requests until the status updates.{#paypal-auth-resp-status_status-5}
  {#paypal-auth-resp-status_status-5}
* `REVERSED`: The authorized funds were released back to the customer and cannot be captured.{#paypal-auth-resp-status_status-reverse}
  {#paypal-auth-resp-status_status-reverse}

Follow-On Requests
------------------

After the payment is authorized, you can send these follow-on requests using the request ID from the authorization response message.

Authorization Reversal
:
To cancel the hold on the authorized funds, you must send an authorization reversal request. For more information, see [Reverse an Authorization](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services/paypal-reversal-intro.md "").

Re-authorization
:
To update information in the authorization, such as the payment amount, you must send a re-authorization request. For more information, see [Re-authorize a PayPal Payment](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services/paypal-reauth-intro.md "").

Capture
:
To capture the authorized funds and complete the payment, you must send a capture request. For more information, see [Capture a Payment](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services/paypal-capture-intro.md "").

Check Status
:
To know when the authorization status updates, you must periodically send a check status request. For more information, see [Check Status for a Transaction](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services/paypal-status-intro.md "").

Re-authorize a PayPal Payment {#paypal-reauth-intro}
====================================================

Re-authorizing an authorized PayPal payment maintains the 3-day honor period in which you can capture the payment. If the 3-day honor period expires because you did not send a re-authorization request, PayPal contacts the card's issuer to re-authorize the payment. When the issuer approves the re-authorization, PayPal accepts the capture request you submitted. Re-authorizing an authorization also enables you to change the payment amount. You can begin requesting a re-authorization 3 days after the original authorization was requested. If you reauthorize a payment on the 28th day of its authorization period, you only have 1 day to capture it. You can only re-authorize *PayPal* payments. Re-authorizing a payment using saved credentials is not supported.

> IMPORTANT If you need to reverse a re-authorized payment, use the initial authorization request ID in the reversal request.

  {#paypal-capture-resp-status_status-3}

* `DECLINED`: The funds were not captured because PayPal declined the request after a review.{#paypal-capture-resp-status_status-4}
  {#paypal-capture-resp-status_status-4}

Process a Sale {#paypal-sale-intro}
===================================

You can process a payment by requesting a sale, which authorizes and captures funds for a payment in the same request. Include the request ID that you received in the create order response in the processingInformation.intentsId request field to link the sale to the created order.  
A `PENDING` status in the response indicates that the request is successful. After sending a sale request, send a follow-on check status request periodically. The payment is complete when you receive a response with a `COMPLETED` status. For more information about sending a check status request, see [Check Status for a Transaction](/docs/gateway/en-us/paypal/developer/all/rest/paypal/paypal-services/paypal-status-intro.md "").
