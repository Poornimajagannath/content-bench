Introduction to the eCheck Service {#echeck-txnprocess-intro}
=============================================================

The eCheck payment service enables merchants to accept electronic check payments using a variety of methods, including mail, telephone, and online orders.  
There are two main types of eCheck transactions:

* A charge is initiated to take money from a customer's bank account and transfer it to the merchant's bank account. Most eCheck transactions are ACH charges.

* A credit or refund is initiated to transfer money back to the customer's bank account.  
  eCheck information can be used in a range of reports. For further information, see these topics:

* [Fields in the Funding Details Report](/docs/gateway/en-us/echeck/user/all/rest/echeck-user-guide/echeck-reports-recon/echeck-reports-recon-funding/echeck-reports-recon-funding-fields.md "")

* [Fields in the Chargeback Details Report](/docs/gateway/en-us/echeck/user/all/rest/echeck-user-guide/echeck-reports-recon/echeck-reports-recon-chargeback/echeck-reports-recon-chargeback-fields.md "")

* [Fields in the Deposit Details Report](/docs/gateway/en-us/echeck/user/all/rest/echeck-user-guide/echeck-reports-recon/echeck-reports-recon-deposit/echeck-reports-recon-deposit-fields.md "")

* [eCheck Reconciliation Reporting Case Study](/docs/gateway/en-us/echeck/user/all/rest/echeck-user-guide/echeck-reports-use-case.md "")

Requirements for Using the eCheck Service
-----------------------------------------

The eCheck service is available to eligible Acceptance Platform Solutions merchants that meet one of these two requirements:

* US citizens or residents who are at least 18 years of age and have been issued a Social Security number.
* United States or foreign-based corporations that use the eCheck services only for customers using US bank accounts and that hold and maintain a bank account in the United States with a US-based financial institution.

eCheck Transaction Types {#echeck-intro-txn-types}
==================================================

There are several ways that eCheck transactions may be originated or received. Each of these transactions is governed by requirements established by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (Nacha).  
Your ability to process any or all of the supported eCheck transaction types depends on the underwriting and risk profile of your eCheck account.  
The type of eCheck transactions that you process also depends on your business model. For example, if you are a mail order/telephone order (MOTO) merchant, you might need to process only transactions initiated over the telephone. However, if you submit transactions exclusively through your e-commerce website, you may need the ability to process all transaction types except for telephone-initiated transactions.

Cash Concentration or Disbursement
----------------------------------

A Cash Concentration or Disbursement (SEC code CCD) is a charge or credit transaction against a customer's business checking account. One-time or recurring CCD transactions are typically fund transfers to or from corporate entities.

* CCD transactions may be submitted only against business or corporate checking accounts.
* An authorization agreement from the corporate customer is required for CCD transactions.

Prearranged Payment and Deposit
-------------------------------

A Prearranged Payment and Deposit (SEC code PPD) is a charge or credit transaction initiated by a merchant against a customer's personal checking or savings account. All credit transactions to personal banking accounts must be submitted as PPD, regardless of the original transaction type. These considerations apply:

* PPD transactions may be submitted only against personal checking and savings accounts. PPD transactions may be originated only when payment and deposit terms between the merchant and the customer are prearranged and in writing. The terms and transaction schedule are arranged between the customer and the merchant in advance of the actual date and time at which the transaction is submitted. PPD transactions cannot be used for telephone-initiated or internet-initiated transactions or for converting a paper check into an electronic payment.
* A written paper authorization from the customer is required for one-time transactions. A written paper authorization agreement indicating that the customer is authorizing a recurring charge to their bank account is required for recurring transactions. For PPD transactions, the customer's payment authorization may NOT be received by telephone or the internet.
* For recurring PPD transactions, the customer may revoke the standing payment authorizations (for example, calling a given telephone number or writing to a given address). Merchants are required to notify customers in writing at least 10 calendar days in advance of when the date or amount of an eCheck transaction is changed.

Telephone-Initiated Entry
-------------------------

A Telephone-Initiated Entry (SEC code TEL) is a one-time or recurring charge transaction against a customer's personal checking or savings account.

* TEL transactions may be originated only when a business relationship between the merchant and the customer already exists. If no relationship exists, TEL entries can be originated only when the customer initiates the telephone call to the merchant. An existing business relationship is defined as follows:

  * A written agreement is in place between the merchant and the customer.
  * The customer has purchased goods or services from the merchant within the past 2 years.
* Affiliates or partners of the merchant are not considered to have an existing relationship with a customer by association. A TEL transaction may not be used by a merchant when there is no existing relationship between the merchant and the customer and the merchant has initiated the telephone call.

* Payment authorization is obtained from the customer via the telephone for each TEL transaction. Prior to the eCheck transaction, authorizations must be either:

  * audio-recorded by the merchant or
* provided to the customer in writing.  
  For an oral authorization obtained over the telephone to be valid, the merchant must record a clear statement of the following:

* that the customer is authorizing a charge to their bank account

* that the customer understands the terms of the authorization, including:

  * customer's name
  * date of the authorization
  * date on or after which the customer's banking account will be charged
  * amount to be charged
* telephone number that is available to the customer during normal business hours  
  Either a copy or the original audio recording of the authorization or the written notice of authorization must be retained for two (2) years from the date of the authorization.

Internet-Initiated/Mobile Entry
-------------------------------

An Internet-Initiated / Mobile Entry (SEC code WEB) is a charge against a customer's personal checking or savings account. One-time or recurring WEB transactions may be initiated by using the internet or a mobile device on a wireless network.  
WEB transactions may only be submitted against personal checking and savings accounts. Merchants are responsible for preventing potentially fraudulent transactions by ensuring that WEB transactions are received from customers whose identities are authenticated, whether it is a PIN at the time of checkout or some other means required by the merchant.  
For a WEB entry, authorization is received from the customer from the internet or a mobile device on a wireless network during the payment or checkout process. Implementation of payment authorization language is up to the merchant, as long as it complies with the authorization requirements stated below. We recommend that payment authorization language appear on the same page that collects the customer's banking account information.  
The customer's payment authorization must meet these requirements:

* Be displayed on a computer screen or other visual display that permits the customer to read or print it.
* Be readily identifiable as an authorization.
* Clearly and conspicuously state its terms including the dollar amount, the effective date of the transfer, and whether the authorization is for a one-time purchase or for a recurring transaction.

For obtaining payment authorizations associated with WEB transactions, an authorization statement combined with a clickable button should be considered. It should clearly state that by clicking the button, the customer is providing authorization.  
For recurring WEB transactions, the merchant must also provide a notice that the customer may revoke the standing payment authorization by notifying the merchant as specified in the payment authorization (for example, calling a given telephone number or writing to a given address). Merchants are required to notify customers at least 10 calendar days in advance of when the date or amount of a recurring eCheck transaction is changed. This notification need only be given once, in advance of the next recurring transaction.

Getting Started with the eCheck Service {#echeck-gs}

Boarding Your Merchant Account for Sandbox Testing {#echeck-partner-onboard-sandbox-merchant}
=============================================================================================

This topic describes how to board the merchant account (MID) that you plan to use for testing eCheck transactions in the sandbox environment. IMPORTANT In order to perform this task, your MID must be enabled for eCheck with self-enablement allowed. If you need to verify the status of your MID, contact your partner user.  
At the final step of the task, upon submittal of the eCheck Application with test data, your MID is automatically enabled for eCheck.

1. Follow these steps to board your merchant account for sandbox testing:
2. Log in to the sandbox `Business Center` as the MID user:  
   ` `<https://businesscentertest.example.com/ebc2>` `{#echeck-partner-onboard-sandbox-merchant_d7e29}
3. In the Available Products module, complete the eCheck Application with the test data you want to use in the sandbox testing environment.  
   For descriptions of fields in the eCheck Application, see [Completing eCheck Application Fields](/docs/gateway/en-us/echeck/user/all/rest/echeck-user-guide/echeck-gs/echeck-application-intro/echeck-application-fields.md "").
4. Click Submit.  
   Unlike an eCheck Application submitted for production processing, this eCheck Application does not go through underwriting because this MID is used only for test transactions.

#### RESULT

When the eCheck Application is submitted with test data, your MID is automatically enabled for eCheck.

Overview of eCheck Transaction Processing {#echeck-txnprocess-overview}
=======================================================================

This sequence describes eCheck transaction processing.

1. The merchant receives authorization from a customer to charge their bank account. The customer provides all of the required bank account information for the eCheck transaction type. After the transaction is submitted, purchase and payment information is securely transmitted to the Payment Gateway server. The transaction is accepted or rejected based on initial data validation and security criteria defined by `Payment Gateway`. Reasons for rejection include invalid routing number, inactive account number, and insufficient information.
2. If the transaction is accepted, `Payment Gateway` formats the transaction information and sends it as an ACH transaction to its bank, the Originating Depository Financial Institution (ODFI), with the rest of the transactions received that day.
3. The ODFI receives the transaction information and passes it to the ACH network for settlement. The ACH network uses the bank account information provided with the transaction to determine the bank that holds the customer's account, the Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI).
4. The ACH network instructs the RDFI to charge the customer's account. The RDFI passes funds from the customer's account to the ACH network. The RDFI also notifies the ACH network of any administrative returns (funds could not be collected from the customer's bank account) or unauthorized returns (the customer disputes the purchase). An eCheck transaction might be returned for not sufficient funds (NSF), invalid account number, account closed, or account frozen. An eCheck transaction might be returned as unauthorized because the customer advised that it was not authorized, payment was stopped, or authorization was revoked. When a transaction is returned, `Payment Gateway` posts the return to the merchant.
5. The ACH network sends the funds to the ODFI (the bank associated with `Payment Gateway`).
6. The ODFI sends any returns to `Payment Gateway`.
7. After the funds holding period, `Payment Gateway` initiates a separate ACH transaction to deposit eCheck proceeds to the merchant's bank account.

eCheck Settlement {#echeck-txnprocess-settlement}
=================================================

Because eCheck payments are made from a customer's bank account, the settlement process is different from the credit card transaction settlement process. For eCheck transactions, settlement occurs when the payment gateway initiates an ACH transaction to collect funds from the customer's bank account. Funding occurs when funds collected are deposited to the merchant's bank account. The timing of eCheck deposits might vary by merchant. Settlement for eCheck transactions occurs each business day, excluding bank holidays. eCheck transactions submitted to `Payment Gateway` before your daily transaction cut-off time are sent to the bank the following business day. The settlement time for each batch of transactions marks the beginning of the `Payment Gateway` funds holding period. Transfer of eCheck proceeds to your bank account occurs on the business day after the transactions are considered collected by the system.
IMPORTANT The availability of funds is not verified in real time, so you should wait until the holding period is over before shipping or providing access to merchandise purchased using eCheck.  
The timeframe for settlement, returns, and funding can vary. These factors can influence timing: the day of the week the transaction is submitted, the number of holding days established for your eCheck account, whether the transaction is returned for any reason, or whether processing occurs over a weekend. eCheck transactions begin their funding when a transaction is captured and settled.  
This sequence describes a typical eCheck processing cycle with a 5-day holding period:

1. The merchant receives an eCheck transaction. At the transaction cut-off time, the transaction is picked up by the payment gateway.
2. The payment gateway submits the previous day's batch to the ACH network. This is the first day of the funds holding period. The number of holding days varies per merchant. For example, 5 days.
3. The ACH network collects funds for the transaction from the customer's bank and sends them to `Payment Gateway`. This is the second day of the funds holding period. The purpose of the holding period is to allow for returns for transactions included in the batch. Returns can come back on this day.
4. Third, fourth, and fifth day of the funds holding period. Returns can come back on this day.
5. The payment gateway sends available eCheck proceeds to the merchant's bank account. Returns can come back on this day.
6. The eCheck proceeds are available in the merchant's bank account. Returns can come back on this day.
   Processing only occurs on banking days, so the timeframe can be extended depending on what day of the week processing and holding days occur. For example, if day 1 in the example above is a Friday, day 2 does not occur until Monday, 2 days later, prolonging the timeframe by 2 days.

eCheck Returns {#echeck-txnprocess-returns}
===========================================

eCheck transactions consists of several validation phases. When first submitted to `Payment Gateway`, eCheck transactions are validated for the presence of required data, such as the bank account number and ABA routing number. After the transaction is submitted to the ACH network, it undergoes additional validations, for example, whether the customer's bank account exists and whether there are enough funds in the bank account. A transaction might be returned for various reasons. An eCheck transaction can pass the initial phases of validation and be returned or rejected later in the cycle.  
These are the three types of eCheck returns:

Insufficient funds (NSF) return
:
This type of return occurs when the customer's bank account does not have sufficient funds for the eCheck transaction.

Unauthorized return (chargeback)
:
These transactions are unauthorized returns:

    * The customer claims they did not authorize the eCheck transaction or had revoked their authorization.
    * The transaction was for a different dollar amount than was originally authorized.
    * The transaction was settled prior to the date of the customer's authorization.

:
Additional reasons for chargebacks are listed in [eCheck Chargebacks](/docs/gateway/en-us/echeck/user/all/rest/echeck-user-guide/echeck-txnprocess-overview/echeck-txnprocess-settlement/echeck-txnprocess-chargebacks.md "").

Administrative returns or returned items
:
This type of return includes all other reasons for a return, such as these:

    * Account is closed.
    * Account number is invalid.
    * Non-transaction account.
    * Account is frozen.

> IMPORTANT
> ` Payment Gateway ` does not automatically resubmit charges returned from a customer's bank due to NSF. You can resubmit transactions returned as NSF or uncollected funds up to two additional times for a total of three submissions. Continued attempts can result in a fine and possible sanctions from Nacha.  
> All unsuccessful eCheck transactions returned through the ACH network includes a return code to indicate the reason for the return. You are responsible for taking any appropriate action when eCheck transactions are returned. The amount of each return is posted to your eCheck settlement account and statement.

eCheck Chargebacks {#echeck-txnrprocess-chargebacks}
====================================================

For transactions made from personal checking and savings accounts, Nacha grants 60 calendar days during which a customer may return a charge item erroneously posted to the customer's bank account. The 60-day window begins the day the bank first made its statement with the transaction listed available to the customer.

> IMPORTANT
> If your eCheck return rates exceed Nacha thresholds, Nacha might require additional information. You will be notified by ` Payment Gateway ` and must immediately respond and become compliant. After becoming compliant you must maintain compliance for the next 180 days. If you cannot reach and maintain compliance, your account might be terminated.

| Return Type    | Nacha % Threshold | FNBO Volume Threshold | Days to Comply | Maintenance Period |
|:---------------|:------------------|:----------------------|:---------------|:-------------------|
| Unauthorized   | 0.50%             | 5 items               | 30 days        | 180 days           |
| Administrative | 3.0%              | 15 items              | 60 days        | 180 days           |
| Total          | 15.0%             | 25 items              | 60 days        | 180 days           |
[Nacha Thresholds for eCheck Returns]

Take precautions to minimize the risk of losses when using the eCheck service. To reduce the potential for chargebacks, you must ensure that you are receiving the proper payment authorization prior to processing an eCheck transaction. You may also want to consider waiting to ship goods until after eCheck transaction proceeds are deposited in your merchant bank account (following the required `Payment Gateway` holding period).

eCheck Credits and Refunds {#echeck-txnrprocess-creditsrefunds}
===============================================================

You may issue credits and refunds for eCheck transactions. The following requirements apply:

* The original eCheck transaction must have been processed through the Payment Gateway.
* eCheck refunds must be submitted with the transaction ID of the original eCheck transaction.
* The amount of the refund must be less than or equal to the amount of the original transaction.
* The sum of multiple refunds submitted against the original transaction must be less than or equal to the amount of the original transaction.
* Your eCheck settlement sub-account must contain available funds (funds that are no longer in the holding period) to cover the refund. If your account does not contain sufficient funds, the refund is rejected.

eCheck Transaction Statuses During Processing {#echeck-status}
==============================================================

A successful eCheck transaction goes through these status changes while it is being processed. All other statuses are standard payment statuses. For information about a specific response, see the [Transaction Response Codes Tool](https://developer.example.com/api/reference/response-codes.md "").

* *Pending*: Transaction was submitted to the payment gateway.
* *Transmitted*: Transaction was sent to the bank or financial institution for settlement.
* *Completed*: No returns was received for this transaction 3 days after it was sent for settlement. The transaction is considered to be completed unless an atypical return is received later.

eCheck Integrations {#echeck-integrations}
==========================================

The eCheck service can be accessed in two ways:

* In the `Business Center`. See [Process eCheck Transactions Using the Business Center](/docs/gateway/en-us/echeck/user/all/rest/echeck-user-guide/echeck-bc-intro.md "")
* Using the REST API. See [Process eCheck Transactions Using the REST API](/docs/gateway/en-us/echeck/user/all/rest/echeck-user-guide/echeck-api-intro.md "")

eCheck Risk Reserve {#echeck-risk-reserve}
==========================================

A risk reserve account might be required as a condition for providing eCheck services. The risk reserve account holds a certain percentage or amount of your eCheck proceeds in reserve to cover potential costs incurred from high-risk or chargeback transactions. To see how risk reserve works in a use case, see [eCheck Reconciliation Reporting Case Study](/docs/gateway/en-us/echeck/user/all/rest/echeck-user-guide/echeck-reports-use-case.md "").  
The risk reserve rate and target are determined during the underwriting process and communicated to the merchant when the application is accepted or might be requested at a later date based on financial condition, processing history, or increased limits.  
A reserve might also be implemented at any time after the account is opened based on an increase in returns, chargebacks, or other risk factors.  
Factors considered when determining whether a risk reserve account is required for your eCheck account might include:

* How long your company has been in business.
* How long your company has conducted business with `Payment Gateway`.
* Your company's transaction history with `Payment Gateway`.
* The credit-worthiness of the financial information you have provided.
* The credit-worthiness of the personal guarantee you have provided.
* Your company's industry type.

The risk reserve is specified by these values:

* The *Reserve Rate* is the percentage rate at which funds are withheld from each eCheck batch settlement for your account.
* The *Reserve Target* is the maximum dollar amount that can be held in your risk reserve account.

A merchant can either have a [fixed reserve](# "") or [no reserve (none)](# "").  
For a [fixed risk reserve](# ""), the reserve balance is established by one of these factors:

* The receipt of a lump sum deposit from you, the merchant.
* Withholding funds at the reserve rate established for the account from each batch settlement until the reserve balance is equal to the *Reserve Target*.
  Your fixed risk reserve can also be established by a combination of lump sum deposit and withholding of settlement funds.  
  As funds are transferred from your eCheck settlement sub-account to the reserve sub-account, the eCheck settlement balance is reduced and the reserve balance is increased by the same amount.  
  Fixed reserves are not automatically released to your merchant bank account; manual intervention is required. Risk reserve funds are withheld at the reserve rate until the reserve target is met. In the event that the reserve target setting for your account is reduced, the difference between the reserve balance and the new reserve target are transferred back to the eCheck settlement account, where available funds will be subsequently deposited to your bank account. When your reserve rate and reserve target are modified, changes become effective for the next batch settlement.

eCheck Processing Limits and Settings {#echeck-processing-limits}
=================================================================

When completing the eCheck application, you can request that a specific monthly and per-transaction limit be considered. However, the eCheck processing limits are determined during the underwriting process for your application. The requested amounts should be based on what you anticipate processing with eCheck. After sufficient processing history is established, you can request a limit increase at the Support Center at [support.example.com](https://support.example.com ""). At that time, the `Payment Gateway` Risk Team will review your account history and can approve, modify, or decline the request to increase your processing limits.
IMPORTANT If you exceed the monthly processing limit, a funding hold is applied to your account and you must contact the Support Center to remove the hold and increase your limit, if needed, based upon your account history.  
Processing settings include:

* *Per-Transaction Limit*: maximum amount allowed for a single eCheck transaction.
* *Monthly Processing Limit*: total amount of charges and refunds allowed per month for eCheck transactions.
* *Funds Holding Period*: number of days that funds from settled eCheck transactions are held before being deposited to your merchant bank account.

eCheck Notice of Change {#echeck-txnprocess-noc}
================================================

A Notification of Change (NOC) is an ACH notice from a customer's bank indicating that an eCheck transaction included incorrect customer or payment information. The bank will correct the information, post the transaction to the customer's bank account, and notify you that payment information needs to be updated. All NOCs will include a code that indicates the necessary change. You are responsible for taking any appropriate action when an NOC is received.  
You must make the necessary changes prior to originating the next eCheck transaction for the same customer. If you are using Recurring Billing be sure to update information in your subscription records. `Payment Gateway` maintains a database of all NOC entries. All submitted eCheck transactions are screened against this list. If the data is not corrected, you will receive an error when attempting to process a new transaction for the customer. Repeated attempts to submit an uncorrected transaction may result in a fine and sanctions from Nacha.  
You may view Notifications of Change received for your eCheck transactions in the `Business Center`:

1. Click Reports in the left navigation.
2. Under Transaction Reports, click Notification of Change.
3. Select the Date Range and click Search to run the report.

Payment Authorization and Authentication for eCheck Transactions {#echeck-txnprocess-pmtauth}
=============================================================================================

eCheck transactions must include both payment authorization and customer authentication in order to be successful.  
For eCheck transactions, an authorization is a paper or electronic document or record "signed" by the customer that authorizes a merchant to submit a charge transaction against their bank account. Merchants are required to obtain authorization from their customer before charging the customer's bank account. Payment authorization must include:

* Clear and conspicuous statement of the terms of the transaction, including amount.

* Written language displayed to the customer that is readily identifiable as an authorization by the customer for the transaction (for example, "I authorize \[Merchant\] to charge my bank account") and that can be reproduced.

* Evidence of the customer's identity.

* The date the authorization was granted and the effective date of the transaction (the transaction may not be processed before the effective date).

* The bank account number to be charged. Only US-based personal checking, savings, and business checking accounts may be used for processing eCheck transactions. Some banks may disallow certain types of these accounts from being used. Contact your bank to verify the types of checking accounts from which you may process eCheck transactions.

* The nine-digit ABA routing number of the customer's bank. The customer can locate their bank's ABA routing number, as well as their bank account number, at the bottom of one of their paper checks.  
  For recurring transactions, the following must also be provided:

* The frequency of the charge.

* The period for which the customer's payment authorization is granted.

* Written language indicating that the customer may revoke the authorization by notifying the merchant as specified in the authorization.
  For eCheck transactions, once a merchant has sufficiently authenticated a customer's identity through a credit check or review of identification, the merchant can issue identity credentials that will allow the customer to set up an account with username and password or personal identification number (PIN) for online transactions at the merchant's site. Identity authentication and payment authorization must occur simultaneously.
  IMPORTANT It is not acceptable to identify a customer when they log in to a website and then later consider that login an authentication when authorizing an ACH transaction.

eCheck Records Retention Requirements {#echeck-txnproces-recret}
================================================================

You must retain all authorizations for 2 years after a transaction completes, after a final recurring transaction, or after a payment authorization is revoked.

* For paper authorizations, you must retain the original authorization.
* For authorizations made over the telephone or over the internet, you must retain a copy of the authorization and a record of the authentication.
* For transactions that involve a paper check, you must retain a copy of the check for a minimum of 2 years because the signed check is considered the customer's authorization.  
  Nacha grants customers 60 days to identify an unauthorized charge. If a customer identifies an unauthorized charge after the 60-day period, the customer's bank can request a copy of the original authorization for the transaction from the merchant through the ODFI. If the appropriate authorization is not provided to the customer's bank within 10 banking days, the ODFI is permitted to allow the customer's bank to return the transaction.

> IMPORTANT
> Although Nacha and ` Payment Gateway ` require record retention for customer authorization records for a period of 2 years, the statute of limitations for state laws governing transaction disputes may dictate a period of between 2 to 7 years. ` Payment Gateway ` recommends that you be familiar with these laws.  
> You must be able to provide a copy of the authorization to the customer upon request. `Payment Gateway` might also request the original or a copy of a customer's payment authorization at any time. Merchants will have 3 business days to comply. If no response is received by the date requested, to avoid a Nacha rules violation, `Payment Gateway` will give permission for the return. If two future requests also go unanswered, `Payment Gateway` assumes that you are giving blanket permission to allow all returns and then accepts them on your behalf.

Accepting eCheck Payments through Unified Checkout, Pay by Link, and Invoicing {#echeck-pay-unified-checkout-invoice-paybylink-intro}
=====================================================================================================================================

There are several ways to accept digital payments with eCheck. Each payment option provides a way to integrate the eCheck payment option into your checkout through a Pay with bank account link, that enables the customer to provide bank account and contact information.

Accepting eCheck Payments through `Unified Checkout` {#echeck_pay_unified_checkout}
===================================================================================

`Unified Checkout` provides a single interface to securely accept digital payments on your website. The supported digital payment methods include eCheck.  
After you integrate `Unified Checkout` with your website, the eCheck payment option appears for your customers on the checkout page as Pay with bank account. After they click Pay with bank account, your customer is then prompted to provide their bank account details, billing address, and contact information before they submit the payment.  
For information on integrating with `Unified Checkout`, see the [*`Unified Checkout` Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/unified-checkout/developer/all/rest/unified-checkout/uc-intro.md "").  
These screen captures show the sequence of events that your customer can expect when completing a payment with a bank account.

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/uc-ui-echeck-7.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Accepting eCheck Payments through Invoices {#echeck-bc-invoicing}
=================================================================

Businesses can bill any customer with an email address and accept digital payments securely from any connected device. If the eCheck payment is enabled for your account, it appears as *Pay with Bank Account* on the checkout page after the merchant clicks the invoice link.  
You can create and manage payment links in your invoices through the `Business Center` or directly integrate Invoice APIs into your own system to automate the creation and management of invoices. For more information on integrating invoicing into your workflow, see the [*Invoicing Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/api-reference-assets/index.md#invoicing "").  
Your customers will follow this workflow to use the payment link on the invoice.

1. eCheck appears as a Pay with Bank Account option on the checkout page.  
   ![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/echeck-invoicing-link.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)
2. When the customer clicks the link, a sidebar appears. In the sidebar, the customer enters information about their bank account and billing address and clicks Continue.  
   ![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/echeck-invoicing-bank.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)
3. In the Contact section, the customer enters their email address and phone number and clicks Continue.
4. In the Confirm section, the customer reviews the information they provided. If necesssary, the customer can click Edit to make changes to any of the information. If the information is correct, the customer clicks Pay to make the payment.  
   ![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/echeck-invoicing-contact.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Accepting eCheck Payments through Payment Links {#echeck-bc-pay-by-link}
========================================================================

Pay by Link provides payment links for selling products or receiving donations online. The links can be set at a fixed price or be configured so that the customer specifies the payment value. These links can be distributed to multiple customers.  
If the eCheck payment method is enabled for your account, it appears as *Pay with Bank Account*on the checkout page after the merchant clicks the payment link.  
You can create and manage payment links through the `Business Center` or directly integrate Pay by Link APIs into your own system to automate the creation and management of payment links. For more information on integrating with Pay by Link, see the [*Pay by Link Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/paybylink/developer/all/rest/paybylink/paybylink-about-guide.md "").  
Your customers will follow this workflow to use the payment link.

1. eCheck appears as a Pay with Bank Account option on the checkout page.

eCheck Reconciliation Reporting Case Study {#echeck-reports-use-case}
=====================================================================

This case study shows an example of eight business days' worth of eCheck activity and how that activity appears on reconciliation reports.  
These reports are reconciliation reports:

* Funding Details Report

* Deposit Details Report

* Chargeback Details Report  
  The case study is written assuming that these things are true about the merchant account:

* Risk Reserve Target: $1,000.00

* Risk Reserve Rate: 10%

* Funding Hold Period: 3 days

* Monthly Transaction Volume Limit: $40,000.00

Day 1 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day1}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-01.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 1, the merchant processes four debit transactions totaling $9,900. The merchant does not process any credit transactions. Because of the 3-day funding hold, no money is moved to the reserve account. All money for day 1 is moved to the settlement account. No reconciliation reports are generated because nothing is funded yet.

Day 2 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day2}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-02.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 2, the merchant processes three debit transactions totaling $4,000 and no credit transactions. Because of the 3-day funding hold, no money is moved to the reserve account. All money for day 2 is moved to the settlement account. No reconciliation reports are generated because nothing is funded yet.

Day 3 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day3}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-03.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 3, the merchant processes one debit transaction totaling $2,000 and one credit transaction totaling $3,000. Because of the 3-day funding hold, no money is moved to the reserve account. All money for day 3 is moved to the settlement account. In this case, because there is $1,000 more credit than debit, $1,000 is removed from the settlement account. No reconciliation reports are generated because nothing is funded yet.

Day 4 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day4}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-04.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 4, the merchant processes three debit transactions totaling $7,000. The merchant does not process any credit transactions. Day 1 is now funded due to the lapse of the 3-day holding period. $990 is moved to the risk reserve account because the risk reserve rate is 10%, and the day 1 total was $9,900. The day 4 total is moved to the settlement account. $5,910 is funded. That amount reflects the settlement account balance, minus the debit totals for days 2, 3, and 4, minus the reserve amount ($990). Because funding occurred, reconciliation reports are generated for day 1 transactions and day 3 credit (there are no holds on credits).

Day 5 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day5}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-05.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 5, the merchant processes two debit transactions totaling $500, and one credit transaction totaling $5,000. $10 is moved to the risk reserve account, bringing the risk reserve account up to its full $1,000. The target funding amount is a negative amount (-$1,010), so nothing is funded on day 5. The settlement amount is -$4,500, so $4,500 is removed from the settlement account. No reconciliation reports are generated because nothing was funded.

Day 6 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day6}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-06.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 6, the merchant processes three debit transactions totaling $8,250 and credit transactions totaling $500. The sum of credit and debit transactions ($7,750) is moved to the settlement account. $490 is funded from days 2 and 3, based on the settlement account balance, minus the debit amounts for days 4, 5, and 6. Reconciliation reports are generated for day 2 and 3 transactions and day 5 and 6 credits.  
On day 6, the $40,000 monthly transaction limit is reached. Consequently, all funding and all credit transactions are put on hold until the following month or until the limit is raised.

Day 7 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day7}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-07.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 7, the merchant processes three debit transactions totaling $2,000 and no credit transactions. $2,000 is moved to the settlement account. $5,750 is funded from day 4, based on the settlement account balances, minus days 5 and 6, and day 7 debit amounts. Reconciliation reports are generated for day 4 transactions and day 7 credits.  
On day 7, a Chargeback Details Report is generated because two returns were sent back by payment processors. A debit for $1,500 was returned because of an incorrect account number, and a credit for $250 was returned because the account was closed. The reason codes listed in the chargeback details report are ACH return codes.

Day 8 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day8}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-08.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 8, the merchant processes three debit transactions totaling $5,000 and no credit transactions. $5,000 is moved to the settlement account. $500 is funded from day 5 and $5,750 is re-deposited (because there was no account to which to move it), for a total deposit amount of $6,250.
