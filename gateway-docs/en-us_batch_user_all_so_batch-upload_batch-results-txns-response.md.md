Viewing the Results of Transaction Processing {#batch-results-txn-response}
===========================================================================

After a transaction batch file is validated successfully, `Payment Gateway` processes the transactions specified in the batch file and then creates *transaction response files*. These CSV-formatted files show the processing results for the batched transaction requests.  
One response file lists processing results for all transactions, whether accepted, rejected, or in error. The other response file lists results only for transactions that were rejected or that triggered a processing error.
