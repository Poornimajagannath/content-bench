Transaction Details API {#txn-details-intro}
============================================

Using the Transaction Details API, you can view the details of any transaction by its request ID. If you do not know the request ID for the transaction, you can use the Transaction Search API to retrieve it. See [Retrieving a Saved Transaction Search Request](/docs/gateway/en-us/txn-search/developer/all/rest/txn-search/txn-search-intro/txn-search-request.md "") for details.
IMPORTANT The Transaction Details API is designed to provide reports of processed transactions for a specific time period. It is not intended for use in real-time transaction processing. During exceptional periods, response times for this API may exceed 2 minutes.
