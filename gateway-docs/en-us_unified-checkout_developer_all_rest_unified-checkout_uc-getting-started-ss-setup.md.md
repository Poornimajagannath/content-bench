Server-Side Set Up {#uc-getting-started-ss-setup}
=================================================

This section contains the information you need to set up your server. Initializing `Unified Checkout` within your webpage begins with a server-to-server call to the Sessions API. This step authenticates your merchant credentials, and establishes how the `Unified Checkout` frontend components will function. The Sessions API request contains parameters that define how `Unified Checkout` performs.  
The server-side component provides this information:

* A transaction-specific public key is used by the customer's browser to protect the transaction.
* An authenticated context description package that manages the payment experience on the client side. It includes available payment options such as card networks, payment interface styling, and payment methods.

{#uc-getting-started-ss-setup_ul_atq_bwq_npb}  
The functions are compiled in a JSON Web Token (JWT) object referred to as the *capture context* . For information JSON Web Tokens, see [JSON Web Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/unified-checkout/developer/all/rest/unified-checkout/uc-appendix/uc-appendix-jwts.md "").

Capture Context {#uc-capture-context-intro}
===========================================

This section contains the information you need to set up your server. Initializing `Unified Checkout` within your webpage begins with a server-to-server call to the Sessions API. This step authenticates your merchant credentials, and establishes how the frontend components will function. The Sessions API request contains parameters that define how `Unified Checkout` performs.  
The server-side component provides this information:

* A transaction-specific public key is used by the customer's browser to protect the transaction.
* An authenticated context description package that manages the payment experience on the client side. It includes available payment options such as card networks, payment interface styling, and payment methods.

The functions are compiled in a JSON Web Token (JWT) object referred to as the *capture context*.  
For information on JWTs see [JSON Web Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/unified-checkout/developer/all/rest/unified-checkout/uc-appendix/uc-appendix-jwts.md ""). The capture context request is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) that includes all of the merchant-specific parameters. This request tells the frontend JavaScript library how to behave within your payment experience. The request provides authentication, one-time keys, the target origin to the `Unified Checkout` integration in addition to allowed card networks and payment types.

Browser Support
---------------

`Unified Checkout` supports these browser versions:

* Safari 16
* Firefox 121
* Google Chrome/Chium-based browsers 118
* Microsoft Edge 118

Capture Context Example {#uc-capture-context-intro_uc-capture-context-codeblock}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the targetOrigins and the allowedPaymentTypes fields to define the target origin and the accepted digital payment methods in your capture context. Use the completeMandate to orchestrate follow-on services such as Payments, `Decision Manager`, `Payer Authentication`, and `TMS`. The data that is included in the capture context are configured in the merchant experience. For information about how to configure these fields, see [Configure Payment Options](/docs/gateway/en-us/unified-checkout/developer/all/rest/unified-checkout/uc-intro-setup/uc-intro-setup-ebc/uc-intro-payment-options.md "") [Configure Customer Data and Payment Flow](/docs/gateway/en-us/unified-checkout/developer/all/rest/unified-checkout/uc-intro-setup/uc-intro-setup-ebc/uc-intro-customer-data.md ""). For information about what fields can be overridden by what is included in the capture context, see [Capture Context Fields in the Business Center](/docs/gateway/en-us/unified-checkout/developer/all/rest/unified-checkout/uc-intro-setup/uc-intro-setup-ebc/uc-ebc-api-info.md "").  
This example shows a capture context with the minimum required fields:

```
{
  "targetOrigins": ["https://merchant.com", "https://reseller.com:8443"],
  "locale": "en_US",
  "country": "US",
  "data": {
	"orderInformation": {
    	"amountDetails": {
      	"totalAmount": "21.00",
      	"currency":  "USD"
          }
      }
  }
}
```

Card Entry Form {#uc-capture-context-intro_uc-capture-context-diagram}

Versioning {#uc_versioning}
===========================

`Unified Checkout` uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.md "") (SemVer). Version numbers use the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format:

* **MAJOR**: breaking changes that require code modifications
* **MINOR**: new features that are backwards compatible
* **PATCH**: bug fixes and improvements that are backwards compatible  
  The server controls which SDK version is loaded for each session that you request. When your server creates a session, the response JWT includes a clientLibrary field that contains the full URL to the correct version of the SDK. Your server parses the JWT, extracts the URL, and passes it to the frontend to load dynamically.

> IMPORTANT
> The ` clientVersion ` field in the session request is optional. When you do not include this field, the server automatically resolves the appropriate version for every session. This ensures that the client-side library and server-side features are compatible.` Payment Gateway ` recommends that you do not include the ` clientVersion ` field in your request and that you use the most recent version. When you do this, your integration benefits from new features, payment methods, and improvements and there are no code changes required.

Pin to a Version
----------------

If you must set your integration to a specific version, you can set the `clientVersion` field to a `MAJOR` version such as `1`, or a `MAJOR.MINOR` version such as `1.2`. The server uses the latest compatible patch release within that range. This ensures that you continue to receive security fixes and bug fixes.

> IMPORTANT
> You cannot pin to a specific patch version (` MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH `). This ensures that all integrations receive critical patches. ` Payment Gateway ` recommends omitting clientVersion from your request unless you have a specific need for pinned behavior.  
> For information about the latest releases, see [Client Version History](/docs/gateway/en-us/unified-checkout/developer/all/rest/unified-checkout/uc-getting-started-ss-setup/uc-capture-context-versions.md "").
