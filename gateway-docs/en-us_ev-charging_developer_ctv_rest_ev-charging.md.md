Introduction to Electric Vehicle Charging {#home}
=================================================

The `Payment Gateway` solution for processing electric vehicle (EV) charging transactions is Card Present Connect \| Electric Vehicle Charging. This solution is built on global standards established by card schemes to ensure reliable, scalable, and secure processing for card-not-present transactions and EMV contact/contactless card-present transactions. Magnetic stripe processing should be used only as a fallback payment method.

Supported Card Types and Entry Modes {#ev-charging-card-types}
==============================================================

These card types are supported for EV charging transactions:

* Mastercard

* Relay  
  These entry modes are supported for EV charging transactions:

* EMV contact and contactless

* Magnetic stripe swipe

Enabling Electric Vehicle Charging on the Card Present Connect Platform {#ev-charging-prereqs}
==============================================================================================

Before integrating `Payment Gateway` services for EV charging transactions, you must have these items in place:

* Merchant account with an acquirer that is enabled for processing EV charging transactions on `Platform Connect`.
* `Payment Gateway` account for payment services.
* Payment technology provider (PTP) that is integrated with `Payment Gateway` and can perform message-level validation (MLV).
* EMV Level 1 certified terminals and EMV Level 2 certified software in preparation for EMV Level 3 Certification.

Validation and Certification {#ev-charging-val-cert}
====================================================

Work with your payment technology provider (PTP) to allocate time to complete the message-level validation (MLV) and EMV Level 3 certification with your EV charging processing system. You must pass MLV before beginning EMV Level 3 certification. You must complete validation and certification before your system can go live. For more information, see [Enabling Electric Vehicle Charging on the Card Present Connect Platform](/docs/gateway/en-us/ev-charging/developer/ctv/rest/ev-charging/home/ev-charging-prereqs.md "").

Message-Level Validation {#ev-charging-mlv}
===========================================

Message-level validation (MLV) is a script-based, field-level validation against `Payment Gateway` specifications.  
Your PTP uses amount-based test triggers to send transactions to a test environment and the Relay Certification Management System for decryption. The test results are XML or RESTful output, `Business Center` test transactions, and log prints.  
`Payment Gateway` uses these tests to validate the results:

* Cross-edit checks
* Data element validation
* Interchange compliance
* Data mapping validation

EMV Level 3 Certification {#ev-charging-emvl3-cert}
===================================================

This topic is an overview of the Level 3 certification with `Payment Gateway` and `Platform Connect`. For details on how to design an EMV Level 3 certified payment application, see EMV Book 3 on the EMVCo website: <https://www.emvco.com>.  
*Certification* is a formal process that for validating the device and application compliance with card scheme acceptance requirements. The certification team uses a brand test tool and simulator. The process includes these elements:

* Using a card simulator such as ICC or Fime.
* Failed case analysis and resolution.
* For Mastercard certification, your PTP submits results to Mastercard and pays the costs for approved partners that Mastercard uses.
* For Relay certification, `Payment Gateway` submits results to Relay.
* Waivers from the card schemes for exceptions.
* Card scheme responses or Letter of Approval (LOA) to signify acceptance and Level 3 certification.  
  Although the processes and support for Global Card Present Connect projects and direct merchant and acquirer projects are different, the timelines are essentially the same.

Card-Present Transaction Risk Control Requirements {#cp-intro-transactions-risk-control}
========================================================================================

Card-present transactions carry lower risk than card-not-present transactions because the customer and payment card are physically present, which can result in lower transaction fees. However, acquirers must still apply standard risk-control measures. Acquirers must monitor transaction activity and manage fraud and disputes in accordance with payment network rules, including the Global Acquirer Risk Standards. They also must comply with these Relay risk compliance programs:

* Relay Fraud Monitoring Program

* Relay Dispute Monitoring Program
  {#cp-intro-transactions-risk-control_ul_gmj_31g_d3c} To meet risk control requirements, acquirers can use one of these options:

* Enable `Payment Gateway` transaction and fraud monitoring tools.

* Ensure that their payment technology partners (PTPs) implement transaction and fraud monitoring tools.

* Deploy their own transaction and fraud monitoring tools.

Each option provides necessary fraud and risk controls for direct merchant relationships and for PTPs that do not operate their own monitoring solutions. For more information, see [Fraud and Risk Management Solutions](https://www.example.com/en-us/solutions/fraud-and-risk-management.md "").

Electric Vehicle Charging Transaction Scenarios {#ev-charging-trxn-types}
=========================================================================

This section describes the EV charging transaction scenarios supported by `Payment Gateway`.

Pre-Pay Transaction Scenario {#ev-charging-prepay-trxn-scenario}
================================================================

The Pre-Pay transaction scenario for EV charging enables a customer to pay in advance for the electricity they plan to use when charging their electric vehicle. The transaction amount is calculated based on the amount of time or number of kilowatts (kW) the customer chooses at the start of the charging session. When the final cost of the charging session is less than the estimated amount, an automatic, host-generated partial reversal request is sent at the time of capture.  
Pre-Pay Transaction Workflow ![Pre-Pay transaction workflow diagram showing the sequence of events in the
transaction process](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/ev-charging/images/evcharging-prepay-700x200.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
The Pre-Pay transaction workflow for EV charging typically consists of this sequence of events:

1. The customer chooses the amount of time or number of kW to charge their electric vehicle and presents a payment method to pre-pay for the EV charging session.
2. The charging session transaction amount is calculated by the EV charging payment system using the amount of time spent charging or number of kW chosen.
3. The authorization request is sent to the issuing bank.
4. The issuing bank approves the transaction and sends an authorization response. A temporary hold for the authorized amount is placed on the customer's payment method.
5. The EV charging session starts. To add more time or kW, the customer must start a new charging session.
6. The EV charging session ends when the customer's chosen amount of time or number of kW is reached. If the charging session ends before the chosen amount of charging is achieved, an automatic, host-generated partial reversal request is sent for the unused transaction amount.
7. A capture request for the final transaction amount is sent to the issuing bank. When the final cost of the charging session is less than the estimated amount, an automatic, host-generated partial reversal request is sent at the time of capture.

Post-Pay Transaction Scenario {#ev-charging-postpay-trxn-scenario}
==================================================================

The Post-Pay transaction scenario for EV charging enables a customer to pay for the electricity they use to charge their electric vehicle when the charging session ends. The final transaction amount is calculated based on the amount of time or number of kilowatts (kW) used during the EV charging session.

#### Figure: {#ev-charging-postpay-trxn-scenario_fig_prs_1kv_pfc}

Post-Pay Transaction Workflow  
![Post-Pay transaction workflow diagram showing the sequence of events in the
transaction process](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/ev-charging/images/evcharging-postpay-700x150.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
The Post-Pay transaction workflow for EV charging typically consists of this sequence of events:

1. The customer can choose a specific amount of time or the number of kilowatts (kW) to charge their electric vehicle or can start a charging session for an unspecified amount.
2. The customer presents a payment method to pay for the EV charging session.
3. The EV charging session starts.
4. The EV charging session ends when the customer's chosen amount of time or number of kW is reached, the battery is fully charged, or the customer manually stops the charging session.
5. The charging session transaction amount is calculated by the EV charging payment system using the amount of time spent charging or the number of kW consumed.
6. A sale request is sent to the issuing bank.

Flexible Transaction Scenario {#ev-charging-flexpay-trxn-scenario}
==================================================================

The Flexible transaction scenario for EV charging enables an efficient and customer- and merchant-friendly solution for EV charging transactions. The transaction amount is calculated based on the amount of time or number of kilowatts (kW) used during the EV charging session. This transaction scenario has implementation prerequisites. For more information, see [Prerequisites for the Flexible Transaction Scenario](/docs/gateway/en-us/ev-charging/developer/ctv/rest/ev-charging/ev-charging-trxn-types/ev-charging-flexpay-trxn-scenario/ev-charging-flexpay-trxn-scenario-prereqs.md "").  
The Flexible transaction scenario offers these features and benefits:

* Real time adjustments to the EV charging session cost. For more information about this key feature, see the description of *dynamic adjustment capability* below.
* Accommodation of variations in charging time and energy consumption.
* Customers benefit from more accurate billing based on actual usage.
* Merchants benefit from receiving accurate payments for the energy provided and reduce the risk of unpaid balances or excessive refunds.

{#ev-charging-flexpay-trxn-scenario_ul_p4q_frv_pfc}  
A key features of the Flexible transaction scenario is the *dynamic adjustment capability*. When the EV charging session costs more than the initially estimated amount, an incremental authorization request is sent to obtain the additional transaction amount. A merchant can send multiple incremental authorization requests during the charging sessions to increase the charging transaction amount. When the final cost of the charging session, including incremental authorizations, is less than the estimated amount, an automatic, host-generated partial reversal request is sent at the time of capture.

#### Figure:

Flexible Transaction Workflow  
![Flexible transaction workflow diagram showing the sequence of events in the
transaction process](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/ev-charging/images/evcharging-flex-700x350.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
The Flexible transaction workflow for EV charging typically consists of this sequence of events:

1. The customer presents a payment method to start a charging session at an EV charging station.
2. The charging session transaction amount is calculated using the amount of time spent charging or number of kW chosen.
3. The authorization request is sent to the issuing bank.
4. The issuing bank approves the transaction and sends an authorization response. A temporary hold for the authorized amount is placed on the customer's payment method.
5. The EV charging session starts.
6. The final transaction amount is calculated by the EV charging payment system based on the charging time or kW consumed. When the transaction amount is more than the initially authorized amount, an incremental authorization is sent to the issuing bank for the difference between the two amounts.
7. The issuing bank approves incremental authorization request, when applies.
8. The EV charging session ends when the battery is fully charged or when the customer manually stops the charging session.
9. A capture request for the final transaction amount is sent to the issuing bank. When the final cost of the charging session, including any incremental authorizations, is less than the estimated amount, an automatic, host-generated partial reversal request is sent at the time of capture.

Prerequisites for the Flexible Transaction Scenario {#ev-charging-flexpay-trxn-scenario-prereqs}
================================================================================================

To implement the Flexible transaction scenario for EV charging, your payment system must have these prerequisite capabilities:

* Calculates initial estimated EV charging cost based on average charging duration and energy consumption.
* Monitors real time EV charging progress.
* Performs incremental authorizations.
* Communicates with payment systems to perform adjustments.

Incremental Authentication Requirements in the European Union {#ev-charging-cvm-sca-eu-increm-auth-reqs}
========================================================================================================

To meet the customer authentication regulatory requirements for incremental authorizations in the European Union (EU), the recommendation is to set the floor limit on the terminal to a very low value. When you use a terminal with this setting to perform a card-present authorization, the Customer Verification Method (CVM) workflow is initiated. The Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) workflow is not initiated for incremental authorizations when you use the recommended floor limits on the terminal.  
For more information about processing incremental authorizations, see [Incremental Authorization for Flexible Scenario](/docs/gateway/en-us/ev-charging/developer/ctv/rest/ev-charging/ev-charging-pymnt-svcs-intro/ev-charging-increm-auth-flexible-intro.md "").

Incremental Authorization for Flexible Scenario {#ev-charging-increm-auth-flexible-intro}
=========================================================================================

Use this information to process an incremental authorization for a Flexible transaction. You can process multiple incremental authorizations for a single EV charging session. Use this type of authorization when the final transaction amount of the charging session is more than the amount of the initial authorization. When the final transaction amount is less than the total authorized amount, an automatic, host-generated partial reversal request is sent.  
For more information about this payment service, see [Flexible Transaction Scenario](/docs/gateway/en-us/ev-charging/developer/ctv/rest/ev-charging/ev-charging-trxn-types/ev-charging-flexpay-trxn-scenario.md "").

> IMPORTANT
> You must meet authentication requirements when processing incremental authorizations in the EU. For more information, see [Incremental Authentication Requirements in the European Union](/docs/gateway/en-us/ev-charging/developer/ctv/rest/ev-charging/ev-charging-pymnt-svcs-intro/ev-charging-cvm-sca-eu-increm-auth-reqs.md "").
