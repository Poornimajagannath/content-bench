Check Status {#paybybank-status-intro}
======================================

Send a check status request to retrieve status updates for either a pending sale or refund. A check status request requires the request ID from the sale response or the refund response, which is the id field value. `Payment Gateway` recommends using the check status service only when you do not receive a webhook notification. To set up a webhook subscription, see [Webhook Subscriptions](/docs/gateway/en-us/pay-by-bank/developer/all/rest/pay-by-bank/paybybank-intro-services/paybybank-webhook-intro.md "").

Endpoints

**Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/pts/v2/refresh-payment-status/`*{id}*{#paybybank-status-intro_d17e193}  
**Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/pts/v2/refresh-payment-status/`*{id}*{#paybybank-status-intro_d17e205}  
Set the *`{id}`* to the request ID of the API service you are retrieving.

Response Statuses {#paybybank-status-intro_section_jgq_qxp_jdc}
---------------------------------------------------------------

`Payment Gateway` responds to your check sale status request with one of these statuses in the status field:

Check Status for a Sale
:
* `ABANDONED`: The customer did not complete checkout within the allotted time, and the redirect URL has expired.
* `COMPLETED`: The customer completed the checkout process.
* `PENDING`: The sale request is accepted but is not complete. Request the check status service to retrieve status updates.
* `REJECT`: The sale request failed. A failed request can be due to either Pay by Bank rejecting the transaction or due to a technical error.
* `SETTLED`: The sale request is settled for the requested amount.

Check Status for a Refund
:
* `PENDING`: The refund request is accepted but is not complete. Request the check status service to retrieve status updates.
* `REFUNDED`: The settled amount is successfully refunded.
* `REJECT`: The refund request failed. A failed request can be due to either Pay by Bank rejecting the transaction or due to a technical error.

The check status service also responds with a reason code in the processorInformation.responseCode field. For more information about reason codes, see [Reason Codes and Pay by Bank Response Codes](/docs/gateway/en-us/pay-by-bank/developer/all/rest/pay-by-bank/paybybank-reference-codes.md "").
