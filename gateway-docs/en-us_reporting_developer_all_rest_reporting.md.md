CARD Platform Connect: Specifications and Conditions for Resellers/Partners {#vpc-partner-reseller-disclaimer}
==============================================================================================================

The following are specifications and conditions that apply to a Reseller/Partner enabling its merchants through Payment Gateway for Platform Connect ("VPC") processing. Failure to meet any of the specifications and conditions below is subject to the liability provisions and indemnification obligations under Reseller/Partner's contract with Relay/Payment Gateway.

1. Before boarding merchants for payment processing on a VPC acquirer's connection, Reseller/Partner and the VPC acquirer must have a contract or other legal agreement that permits Reseller/Partner to enable its merchants to process payments with the acquirer through the dedicated VPC connection and/or traditional connection with such VPC acquirer.
2. Reseller/Partner is responsible for boarding and enabling its merchants in accordance with the terms of the contract or other legal agreement with the relevant VPC acquirer.
3. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that all considerations and fees associated with chargebacks, interchange downgrades, settlement issues, funding delays, and other processing related activities are strictly between Reseller and the relevant VPC acquirer.
4. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that the relevant VPC acquirer is responsible for payment processing issues, including but not limited to, transaction declines by network/issuer, decline rates, and interchange qualification, as may be agreed to or outlined in the contract or other legal agreement between Reseller/Partner and such VPC acquirer.

DISCLAIMER: NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS BY THE CARD PLATFORM CONNECT ACQUIRER IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS. NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR RESELLER/PARTNER BOARDING MERCHANTS OR ENABLING MERCHANT PROCESSING IN VIOLATION OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE RELEVANT CARD PLATFORM CONNECT ACQUIRER.

Reporting API {#reporting_api}
==============================

Using the Reporting API, you can:

* View report attributes before creating a subscription
* View report subscriptions
* Create, edit, and delete report subscriptions
* Download reports
* Create one-time reports

For detailed information about reports or how to migrate to REST from our servlets, see these guides:

* [Reporting User Guide](https://apps.example.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/reporting_and_reconciliation/Reporting_User/html "")

Creating Requests With a Client Application {#reporting-client-apps-create-request}
===================================================================================

The client uses GET, POST, and PUT methods to send requests to the server. To send the request, you must include an authorization token in the header and specify the format for the report that you want to download.

Request Format
--------------

To create a request, you must send an HTTP message to the report server with your client application. The URL and method that you specify in your message indicates which function you are requesting and the parameters of the request. Partners can specify the organization ID, which enables them to create requests that return data for a specific merchant. For example, to download a report, you would format the URL as follows:

```
https://&lt;url_prefix&gt;/reporting/v3/report-downloads?organizationId={organizationId}&download=true&reportDate={date}&reportName={reportName}
```

If the organizationId field value is `SampleMerchant`, you would use the following URL to download the report from February 20, 2018, titled SampleDailyReport from the production system:

```
https://&lt;url_prefix&gt;/reporting/v3/report-downloads?organizationId=SampleMerchant&reportDate=20180220&reportName=SampleDailyReport
```

> IMPORTANT
> Pass the organizationId field in the request only if you are a partner creating a request to retrieve data for a specific merchant. Otherwise, the organizationId field is passed in your authentication method and not required in the request.

Client Application Requirements
-------------------------------

To connect to the report server, your client application must support HTTPS encrypted by using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Your client application must support HTTP/1.1 and TLS 1.2 connections.  
HTTPS libraries are available for many programming languages, including Java, C/C++, Perl, and Visual Basic. You can implement a client in any language that allows you to use HTTPS to communicate with the report server.

> IMPORTANT Although you may be able to use a third-party client application to download the reports, we do not recommend or support third-party client applications or client libraries that may interfere with our applications.

Request Header
--------------

The default format for responses is JSON, but some reports can also return CSV or XML. You can set the response to return CSV or XML in the request header by setting the `Accept` value to either `application/xml` or `text/csv`. The report format can be set for the following reports:

* Conversion Detail
* Purchase and Refund Detail

Viewing Report Definitions {#reporting-definitions-view}
========================================================

You can view a list of supported reports and their attributes before subscribing to them. You can also view the attributes of an individual report type.  
For a summary of all reports, the request format is:

```
GET https://&lt;url_prefix&gt;/reporting/v3/report-definitions?organizationId={organizationId}
```

Creating and Updating Report Subscriptions {#reporting-subscriptions-create-update}
===================================================================================

To create or update a report subscription, your client application must send an HTTP PUT request to the report server. The request body contains the details for creating the subscription, such as the report type, the start time, and the frequency. The format of the URL is as follows:

```keyword varname
PUT https://&lt;url_prefix&gt;/reporting/v3/report-subscriptions

* 200: Ok.
* 304: Not modified.

Deleting Report Subscriptions {#reporting-subscriptions-delete}
===============================================================

To delete a report subscription, your client application must send an HTTP DELETE request to the report server. The format of the URL is as follows:

```keyword varname
DELETE https://&lt;url_prefix&gt;/reporting/v3/report-subscriptions/{reportName}
```

For example, if you wanted to delete a report titled Daily Transactions, the request would be:

```keyword varname
DELETE https://&lt;url_prefix&gt;/reporting/v3/report-subscriptions/DailyTransactions
```

The default format for responses is JSON, but some reports can also return CSV or XML. You can set the response to return CSV or XML in the request header by setting the `Accept` value to either `application/xml` or `text/csv`.  
Format the URL as follows:

```keyword varname
