Getting Started with `Business Center` `Reports` {#ID-0000004a}
===============================================================

Several reports are automatically enabled for you during the onboarding process, so it is easy to get started with `Business Center` reporting. You can use the Standard reports as is or you can customize them to fit your needs.  
Merchant accounts created in the `Business Center` before May 2019 are not auto-enabled for Standard reports. For information on enabling these reports, see [Subscribing to Standard Reports](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/Creating_Accessing_Downloadable_Reports/c_Subscribing_to_Standard_Reports.md "").  
The `Business Center` offers several reporting options for you to access and download your transaction data:

* Standard reports---Track and reconcile your payment activity.
* Custom reports---Use building blocks to create reports for your specific needs.
* Specialized reports---Track and review how you use additional services such as `Decision Manager`, Account Updater, and Tax Calculation.

These reports are available on the `Available Reports` page. Each report contains specific fields to help you understand your transaction data:

* [Transaction Request](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/c_Reports_Available_in_the_Business_Center/c_Transaction_Request.md "")---Daily transaction level report that shows details related to individual transactions. Logs all of your `Business Center` payment gateway activity.
* [Payment Batch Detail](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/c_Reports_Available_in_the_Business_Center/c_Payment_Batch_Detail.md "")---Daily transaction level report that shows all of your sales and refunds that were submitted to your payment processor through the `Business Center`. Tracks which of your transactions have been settled.
* [Payment Events](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/c_Reports_Available_in_the_Business_Center/c_Payment_Events.md "")---Daily transaction level report that shows payment notifications received from your payment processor (for selected processors). Tracks information related to your transactions such as payment notifications and exceptions.
* [Payment Batch Summary](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/c_Reports_Available_in_the_Business_Center/c_Payment_Batch_Summary1.md "")---Summary level report that shows the quality and amount of your sales and refunds by currency and payment method.

To learn more about generating and downloading reports, see:

* [Reports Available in the `Business Center`](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/c_Reports_Available_in_the_Business_Center.md "")---Provides a complete list of all reports available in the `Business Center`, including what each report contains, how to find it, and who can use it.
* [Creating and Accessing Downloadable Reports](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/Creating_Accessing_Downloadable_Reports.md "")---Provides information about downloadable reports, including instructions for creating standard and custom reports.
* [Viewing On-Demand Reports](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/c_Viewing_On-Demand_Reports.md "")---Provides information about reports you can generate on demand.

Related Information {#ID-0000006e}
==================================

To get started using the Reporting API to download your data for use in other business systems, see the [Developer Center](https://developer.example.com/ "").

Creating and Accessing Downloadable Reports {#ID-0000007e}
==========================================================

The `Business Center` generates and stores reports to which you subscribed on the Available Reports page. These reports include standard, preconfigured reports that you enabled and any custom reports you created. For a list of fields and descriptions you can include in downloadable reports, see [Report Fields and Descriptions](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/c_Report_Fields_and_Descriptions.md "").  
Partners and account-level users can also create reports that consolidate data for one or all merchants, or a selected group of merchants, in their portfolios.  
Some merchants, including those processing alternate payment methods, may have access to financial data. For more information about these types of reports, see [Financial and Reconciliation Reports](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/c_Financial_and_Reconciliation_Reports.md "").

How and When Reports Are Generated {#ID-0000008a}
=================================================

You can choose one or both of the following options to create downloadable reports:

* Choose to have your reports built on a regular frequency, such as every day or every week. For example, create a subscription for a daily report covering transactions between 5 p.m. and 5 p.m. The `Business Center` automatically generates the report daily.
* Create as-needed reports to review your transaction history. For example, configure a one-time (as-needed) report that includes all refund transactions in the month of March 2019. The `Business Center` immediately begins building the report.

Downloadable reports are created asynchronously, so they are not available immediately after you create them. As soon as the report is generated, the `Business Center` adds it to the list of `Available Reports` that you can download. For more information, see [Downloading `Available Reports`](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/Creating_Accessing_Downloadable_Reports/c_Downloading_Available_Reports.md "").

Report Frequency and Start Time {#ID-00000092}
==============================================

Report frequency and start time determine the contents of a report. When the report runs, it uses the start time and frequency to determine the ending time for transactions included in the report. The frequency controls how often your report is generated. For example:

* A daily report scheduled to start at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time runs every day and contains transactions that occurred between 5:00 p.m. the previous day and 4:59 p.m. Pacific Time of the current day, every day. A daily report that runs at 5:00 p.m. on February 2 includes transactions for February 1, 5:00 p.m., through February 2, 4:59 p.m.
* A weekly report scheduled to start at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a Monday contains transactions from the previous 7 days that occurred between 11:00 a.m. on the first day of the time period and 10:59 a.m. on the last day. A weekly report that runs at 11:00 a.m. on February 13 includes transactions for February 6, 11:00 a.m., through February 13, 10:59 a.m.
* A monthly report scheduled to start at 6:00 a.m. Pacific Time on the 1st will contain transactions from the previous 28-31 days that occurred between 6:00 a.m. on the first day of the time period and 5:59 a.m. on the last day. A monthly report that runs at 6:00 a.m. on February 1 includes transactions for January 1, 6:00 a.m., through February 1, 5:59 a.m.

Report Generation Date and Time {#ID-0000009a}
==============================================

The generation date and time of a report varies depending on the amount of time it takes to generate the report. Recurring daily reports for merchants are generated and available for download within six hours of the start time. For example:

* A daily report that spans 5:00 p.m. to 4:59 p.m. might have a generate time of 7:00 p.m.
* A daily report that spans 11:00 p.m. to 10:59 p.m. might have a generate time of 1:00 a.m. the following day.

The exact amount of time that is needed to generate a recurring daily report varies based on the size of the report and the load on the system. Weekly, monthly, as-needed reports, or reports for partners, might take longer than six hours to generate.  
A report's *generate date* reflects the actual date the report is created. The report's *date range* reflects the period of time the report data covers. For example, you can generate a report on:

* May 4, which includes transactions processed between January 1 and January 31.
* February 1, which includes transactions processed between January 1 and January 31.
* May 4, which includes transactions processed only on May 1.

The batch time set in the Production environment is based on your merchant configuration. The batch time set in the Test environment is 12:00 am Pacific Time and cannot be changed.

Service Level Targets for Generating Reports {#ID-000000ab}
===========================================================

Recurring daily reports for merchants are expected to generate within six hours of the start time. For example, if a report starts at 1:00 a.m., it should be available for download by 7:00 a.m.  
Reports for account-level users and partners, weekly and monthly reports, and as-needed reports may take longer to generate, based on the amount of data in the report.

File Retention and Lookback Range Information {#ID-000000ae}
============================================================

File retention period and lookback range vary by report type. Contact your `Payment Gateway` representative for more information.

Downloading `Available Reports` {#ID-000000fa}
==============================================

You can download any report after the `Business Center` completes the request and makes your file available. Daily, recurring reports are available for download within six hours of the report start time. Weekly, monthly, and one-time reports might take longer than six hours to generate.

Downloading Available Reports {#ID-000000fc}
============================================

1. On the left navigation pane, click the Reporting icon.
2. Under Downloadable Reports, click `Available Reports`. The `Available Reports` page appears.
3. Click the tab containing the report you want to download.
4. In the Download column, click the file format link. Only reports that have successfully completed generating and contain data include links.
5. Follow your browser's instructions to open and save the file.

Using Keyword Filters to Locate Reports {#ID-0000010c}
======================================================

Use the Keyword filter in the search toolbar to filter the contents on the `Available Reports` page. When you enter a string into the keyword filter, the `Business Center` searches across all columns on the screen.  
**Example**: Enter "18" in the Keyword filter to locate any report with "18" in the Report Name, Generate Date, or Date Range fields.  
**Example**: Enter "batch" in the Keyword filter to locate any report with "batch" in the Report Name or Report Type fields.

One-Time Reports {#ID-00000112}
===============================

The `Business Center` enables you to create your one-time reports, which are useful when:

* You need information about transactions that occurred before you set up your recurring subscription.
* You want to test a report before setting up a recurring subscription.
* You need a particular type of information only one time, making a recurring subscription unnecessary.
* When you need information from before the previous 31 days, you can create multiple one-time reports. In order to protect system performance, each user is able to generate up to three one-time reports concurrently. Additional one-time reports can be scheduled after the first three reports are generated.

{#ID-00000112_intro-2}  
After your one-time report is generated, it is available to download on the `Available Reports` page. Depending on the size of the report, it can take longer than six hours to generate.  
The process for creating a report subscription is the same as for creating a one-time report. You can create a one-time report using the following steps. To create a custom subscription, see [Creating New Custom Report Subscriptions](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/Creating_Accessing_Downloadable_Reports/c_Creating_Custom_Reports/c_Creating_New_Custom_Report_Subscriptions.md "").

Subscribing to Standard Reports {#ID-0000019c}
==============================================

You can enable or disable a subscription for any standard report. You can also change the frequency and output format of any standard report. The `Business Center` automatically generates reports for enabled subscriptions and makes them available on the Available Reports page.  
To save a standard report as a template, click Save As to create a new custom report. You can change the report details of the new report, including subscription cycle and included data. For more information, see [Creating New Custom Report Subscriptions](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/Creating_Accessing_Downloadable_Reports/c_Creating_Custom_Reports/c_Creating_New_Custom_Report_Subscriptions.md "").

Modifying a Standard Report Subscription {#ID-000001a2}
=======================================================

1. On the left navigation pane, click the Reporting icon.
2. Under Downloadable Reports, click Report Subscription Management. The Report Subscription Management page appears.
3. Click the Standard Report Subscriptions tab. The Standard Report Subscriptions List appears.
4. Select one or more of the following:
   * In the Enable column, select the box to activate the subscription; deselect the box to inactivate it.
   * In the Frequency column, click the Down Arrow icon to modify how often the report is generated.
   * In the Format column, click the Down Arrow icon to modify the file format of the report.

* Click Save As to create a new version of the report. For more information, see [Saving Existing Reports as New Subscriptions](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/Creating_Accessing_Downloadable_Reports/c_Creating_Custom_Reports/Saving_Existing_Reports_as_New_Subs.md "").

Generating Reports for Multi-Currency Transactions {#ID-000001c0}
=================================================================

Multi-currency transactions involve a conversion of funds from the currency in which the transaction is processed to the currency actually deposited in the merchant's account. Multi-currency reporting includes exchange rate conversion data so you can reconcile the multi-currency transaction with the corresponding deposit.  
You can create reports in the `Business Center` that include the original and local amounts for each transaction, and the exchange rate applied, by modifying the standard Funding Detail report. When you modify the Funding Detail report, it becomes a new custom report subscription.  
Only some acquirers provide multi-currency data. Contact Customer Support to determine if your payment processor supports this feature.

Creating a Multi-currency Report Subscription {#ID-000001c4}
============================================================

1. Follow the steps in [Subscribing to Standard Reports](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/Creating_Accessing_Downloadable_Reports/c_Subscribing_to_Standard_Reports.md "") to locate the Funding Detail Report standard report subscription.

2. Click the Save As icon. The Save As New Subscription page appears.

3. Click the Standard Report Subscriptions tab. The Standard Report Subscriptions List appears, and the Report Type list displays `Funding Detail Report`.

4. Enter a unique report name, and select the frequency and output for your report.  **Global Payment (GPN) merchants** : Because multi-currency data are not delivered to the `Business Center` before the 5:00 p.m. report generation time, be sure to select the 11:00 p.m. option in the Subscription Start Time list.

5. In the Advanced Report Features section, click the down arrow. The panel expands.

6. On the Field Selection tab, scroll down to the Funding fields section, then click the down arrow to expand the section.

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   * Exchange Rate
   * Exchange Rate Date
   * Local Amount
   * Local Currency
   * Original Amount
   * Original Currency
8. Click Save As. The Report Subscription Management page appears.

9. To view the new report, click the Custom Report Subscription tab.

Creating Custom Reports {#ID-000001f0}
======================================

The `Business Center` enables you to create your own reports based on the type of data you want to track such as authorizations, sales, or refunds. When you create a report subscription, the `Business Center` provides a default set of fields for you to choose from. You can also add and remove additional fields based on your needs, choose the order in which they appear, and how they display in the report. For a list of fields and descriptions, see [Report Fields and Descriptions](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/c_Report_Fields_and_Descriptions.md "").  
You can also set how often you want to generate the custom report (one-time or recurring). Successfully generated reports appear on the `Available Reports` page. To create a custom report subscription, you can create a brand new subscription or save an existing standard or custom report as a new report.

New Custom Report Subscriptions {#ID-000001f4}
==============================================

A recurring report subscription is a template that describes the attributes of a report, including how often it runs and the period of time it spans. After your recurring report is generated, it is available for download on the `Available Reports` page. You can maintain up to 20 report subscriptions at any time.  
In addition to choosing from available fields, you can customize the following attributes of a recurring subscription:

* **Name**: a unique name for the report. The name cannot be changed after a report is created.
* **Report type**: a set of reports that can be customized. The report type cannot be changed after a report is created.
* **Format**: the format of a generated report (XML or CSV).
* **Frequency**: the frequency at which a report runs (daily, weekly, or monthly).
* **Start time**: the time of day at which a report runs.

The process for creating a report subscription is the same as for creating a one-time report. You can create recurring subscriptions using the following steps. To generate a one-time report, see [Generating One-Time Reports](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/Creating_Accessing_Downloadable_Reports/c_Generating_One-Time_Reports.md "").

Configuring Payment Batch Detail Report Batch Times {#ID-000002cd}
==================================================================

You can use the Payment Batch Detail report to monitor the batch submission process and help predict your cash flow/funding timing. The batch date and time represents the date and time that the `Business Center` batched the transactions to the processors.  
To ensure that the report contains the most recently batched transactions, schedule the report to begin an hour or two after your daily batch end time. You can also choose to schedule multiple Payment Batch Detail reports to suit your needs.  
There are nuances to consider when scheduling your Payment Batch Detail report because the report contains transactions with a batch date and time that occur within the given interval.  
For some merchants, the batch cut-off time may occur after the end of the logical business day. For example:

* Your logical business day begins at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time.
* Your logical business day ends at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time.
* Your batch end time is 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

In this situation, it would be useful to schedule the report to begin at 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time so that it contains the transactions batched from the logical business day.  
For other merchants, the batch cut-off time may occur within the logical business day. For example:

* Your logical business day begins at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
* Your logical business day ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time.
* Your batch cut-off time is 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

In this situation, transactions from your logical business day will span two batches. Some transactions will be in the batch at 9:00 p.m. and others will be in the next day's batch. You might want to schedule your report to begin at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time because transactions with a batch date after 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time appear on the following day's batch and report, You can also choose to schedule multiple Payment Batch Detail reports to suit your needs.  
For some merchants, the batch date will occur one calendar day after the transactions occur.  
Sometimes a transaction request date is different from the batch date. For example:

* May 1, 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time---a sale is authorized.
* May 3, 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time---the sale is captured (settled).
* May 4, 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time---The `Business Center` receives acknowledgment from the processor that the sale batched successfully.

[Card-Present Field Descriptions for the Transaction Request Report]

Fields with Compound Values {#ID-00002d17}
==========================================

Some of the new reports contain different field names and headers. In some cases, multiple fields have been combined into a single field with values separated by commas. For example, the `rcode`, `rflag`, and `rmsg` responses for each application have been combined into `ics_rcode`, `ics_rflag`, and `ics_rmsg`. If a transaction called the `ics_auth` and `ics_bill` applications, the `ics_rcode` field could contain 1,1.

Frequently Asked Questions {#ID-00002e64}
=========================================

This section includes responses to common questions and scenarios you might encounter while using reports in the `Business Center`.  
***Can I order my fields in an XML downloadable report?***  
The XML industry standards do not require field order to be specified. All industry standard XML parsers are compatible with unordered elements. For more information, see <https://www.w3schools.com/xml/el_all.asp>.  
***How soon will my generated report be ready?***  
Daily, recurring reports are available for download within 6 hours of the report start time. Weekly, monthly, and one-time reports might take longer than 6 hours. Reports for partners also may require longer than 6 hours to generate.  
***Is there a limit to the size of a generated report?***  
The report can be any size, but it might take more time to download depending on the file size and the user's network speed.  
***Where can I find report field descriptions***?  
See [Report Fields and Descriptions](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/c_Report_Fields_and_Descriptions.md "").  
***Which report fields can I add to a report?***  
For a list of available fields in each report, see [Fields and Descriptions for Downloadable Reports](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/c_Report_Fields_and_Descriptions/Fields_Descriptions_Downloadable_Reports.md "").  
***How can I identify declined authorizations in my reports?***  
In the Transaction Request Report, authorizations are recorded in the **ApplicationName** field as `ics_auth`. If the authorization was declined, the value in the **RCode** field will be `0`. You can find additional information related to the decline in the **RFlag** and the **RMsg** fields.  
***How do I interpret an authorization reply flag (rFlag)?***  
For more information, see [Reply Flags \& Messages on the Customer Support site.](https://www.example.com/developers/other_resources/quick_references/reply_flags/ "")  
***What is the reporting cycle of the Invoice Summary Report?***  
The Invoice Summary report contains transactions that happen between 12:00 a.m. on the first day of the month and 11:59:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the last day of the month.  
***Why can't I change the time and time zone of the Invoice Summary Report?***  
The Invoice Summary report is designed to run on the same cycle as your monthly billing. This report is expected to contain the transactions that are billed for the month.  
***How can I get a one-time Invoice Summary report to cover the same period of time as my monthly invoice?***  
To create a one-time Invoice Summary report that reflects your monthly invoice, select the start date as the first day of the month; the end date as the last day of the month; and time zone as GMT.  
***Can I reconcile the Payment Batch Detail Report with the same report in the old `Business Center`?***  
If you would like to configure your new Payment Batch Detail report to contain the same transactions that appear in the same report in the old `Business Center`, schedule the report to begin at 12:00 AM PST. In this case, the two reports will contain the same transactions.  
***Is the Acquirer Reference Number (ARN) is reflected in any acquiring reports?***  
It is exposed as Transaction Reference Number in the `Business Center` reports. The GPN returns the ARN, which is a combination of the `Payment Gateway` `trans_ref_no` field with some specific information from Global Payments.

Financial and Reconciliation Reports {#ID-00002e9f}
===================================================

The `Business Center` enables merchants processing credit card or alternate payments to generate reports containing financial / reconciliation data. For alternate payment merchants, reporting supports both direct merchants and those using financial service providers. For more information about payment processing for alternate payments, see the [Alternate Payment Services support documentation](https://www.example.com/developers/documentation/alternative_payment_services/ "").
NOTE Based on the acquirer and processor you use, one or more of the reports in this section may be available. Contact your representative for more information about which reports are applicable to your organization.  
For instructions on creating report subscriptions and generating downloadable reports, see [Creating and Accessing Downloadable Reports](/docs/gateway/en-us/reporting/user/all/ebc/reporting-ug/Creating_Accessing_Downloadable_Reports.md "").

Net Funding {#ID-00003b71}
==========================

You can view the daily interchange, discount, and standard assessments in the Net Funding report. Some month-end fees, such as authorizations, are detected at the end of the month and appear in the Net Funding report on that particular day. Total Net Funding is obtained after subtracting chargebacks, fees, and any other negative amounts.  
By default, the report shows data from the prior day, but you can also choose to view by the previous week, previous month, previous three months, or previous six months. You can also choose to export the data to a CSV, XML, or JSON file.  
The Net Funding report is available only to select merchants. For more information, contact your representative.

Original Credit `Transaction Reports` for Acquirers {#ID-00003b8c}
==================================================================

An Original Credit Transaction (OCT) is a financial transaction that delivers funds directly to a recipient's eligible account. Unlike a purchase transaction, which debits a cardholder's account, an OCT credits the cardholder's account.  
The funds flow in a different direction than in typical card transaction. A full financial BIN is required and the liability to pay lies with the acquirer. Once the issuer accepts the transaction the transaction is completed and funds are pulled from the acquirer in the next settlement window. There are no reversals or chargebacks that can be originated by the acquirer.  
Original Credit Transactions can be used for a variety of services:

* Money Transfers
* Funds Disbursements
* Prepaid Loads
* Merchant Settlements
* Credit Card Bill Payments
* Loyalty and Offers
* Wallet Transfers
