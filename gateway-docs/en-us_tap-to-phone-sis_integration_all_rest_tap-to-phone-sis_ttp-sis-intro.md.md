Introduction to Acceptance Devices \| Tap to Pay on Android Acceptance Devices App {#ttp-sis-intro}
===================================================================================================

The Tap to Pay on Android Acceptance Devices App enables partners to easily integrate their point-of-sale (POS) systems with supported Android devices in a semi-integrated manner using Local and Cloud modes. Leveraging the Acceptance Devices Android app and using API requests, your POS system can accept payments by communicating with the Android device over a local Wi-Fi network or the cloud.  
The solution can also be operated in Standalone mode. This mode does not require integration with a POS system and enables you to start transactions directly from the Android device.  
For more information about the modes available in the Acceptance Devices app, see:

* [Local Mode Payment Services](/docs/gateway/en-us/tap-to-phone-sis/integration/all/rest/tap-to-phone-sis/ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-intro.md "")
* [Cloud Mode Payment Services](/docs/gateway/en-us/tap-to-phone-sis/integration/all/rest/tap-to-phone-sis/ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-cloud-mode-intro.md "")
