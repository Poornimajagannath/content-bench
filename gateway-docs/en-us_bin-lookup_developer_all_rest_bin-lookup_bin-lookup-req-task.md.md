Requesting the BIN Lookup Service Using the REST API {#bin-lookup-req-task}
===========================================================================

`Payment Gateway` recommends that you send the full payment card number (PAN), a TMS token, or a network token when you request the BIN Lookup Service. This ensures that a single BIN record is identified during the request. Even though the service supports sending the six-digit or eight-digit card prefix in the request, this option can result in a `MULTIPLE` record match error if a single BIN record cannot be identified.

> IMPORTANT
> When you receive a ` MULTIPLE ` status record match error, we recommend you provide the full payment card number, a TMS token, or a network token to receive a ` SUCCESS ` status in the response.  
> Send one of these payment credentials to the BIN Lookup Service to get the payment card account information.  
> **Payment Card Numbers**

* Full payment card number (recommended best practice)

* Eight-digit card prefix (not recommended because it might result in a `MULTIPLE` status record match error)

* Six-digit card prefix (not recommended because this option can result in a `MULTIPLE` status record match error)  
  **Tokens**

* `TMS` customer ID token

* `TMS` payment instrument token

* `TMS` instrument identifier token

* `TMS` jti transient token

* `Flex API` JWT transient token

* Network tokens (Relay VTS, Mastercard MDES, and Discover)  
  Follow these steps to request the BIN Lookup Service:

1. Send the request to the BIN Lookup Service endpoint:
