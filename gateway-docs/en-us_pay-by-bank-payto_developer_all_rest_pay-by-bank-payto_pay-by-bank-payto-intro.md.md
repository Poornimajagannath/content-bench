Introduction to PayTo Pay by Bank {#pay-by-bank-payto-intro}
============================================================

`Payment Gateway` offers PayTo Pay by Bank, a payment method that enables your e-commerce customers to pay directly from their bank accounts. When using PayTo, your customers do not need to enter their card information. After you integrate PayTo into your checkout experience, your customers select the **Pay by Bank** option. This checkout option enables your customers to choose their bank from a list of trusted partner banks to authorize the payment. After payment approval, the funds transfer from your customer's account to your merchant account. This payment method is an account-to-account (A2A) transfer.

Getting Started with REST {#pay-by-bank-payto-intro_section_cqr_v3s_fgc}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To process payments through `Payment Gateway`, set up your payment processing system to be REST compliant. `Payment Gateway` uses the REST architecture for developing web services. REST enables communication between a client and server using HTTP protocols.  
If you have not set up secure communications between your client and server using either a JSON Web Token or HTTP signature, see the *[Getting Started with REST Developer Guide](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-intro.md "")*.
