Registering with Samsung Pay {#samsungpay_registering}
======================================================

1. Create a profile by completing the merchant application on the Samsung Pay Partner Portal.

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   After your merchant application is approved, you receive a unique partner ID. Include this ID in your application. You need the partner ID in order to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in the ` Business Center `. Samsung requires the CSR file in order to encrypt sensitive payment data; it contains an identifier and public key.

2. Using the Samsung Pay Partner Portal, upload the CSR file.

3. Enter an application name and a package name. When you associate the CSR file with the application, Samsung generates a product ID.

4. Create login details for application developers on the Samsung Pay Partner Portal.

5. Download and integrate the Samsung Pay SDK into your application.

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   The SDK contains:

   * A Javadoc
   * The Samsung Pay SDK files *samsungpay.jar* and *sdk-v1.0.0.jar*
   * A sample app
   * The branding guide
   * Image files
6. Register a Samsung account ID and request a *debug-api-key* file using the Samsung Pay Partner Portal. The Samsung account ID, the *debug-api-key*, and the product ID are used to validate your application so that you can use the Samsung Pay SDK for testing.

7. Submit your application for approval using the Samsung Pay Partner Portal. Upload the final version of the Android Application Package (APK) file using the Samsung Pay Partner Portal, and include screenshots of your checkout page displaying the Samsung Pay logo.

Registering with `Payment Gateway` {#samsungpay_registering_cybs}

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   > Only one CSR is permitted for each unique Samsung partner ID. If you modify your Samsung partner ID, you must generate a new CSR.

9. Complete the enrollment process by submitting your CSR to Samsung.

Creating a Project {#samsungpay-creating-project}
=================================================

You use Android Studio to create a new Android Studio project, which is required to integrate the Samsung SDK.

1. Download Android Studio from the following website: [https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.md "").
2. Open Android Studio and click Start a new Android Studio project.
3. In the New Project settings menu, enter the name of your application and the company domain.
4. To change the package name, click Edit. By default, Android Studio sets the last element of the project's package name to the name of your application.
5. Click Next.
6. In the Target Android Devices settings menu, choose the required API levels.
7. Click Next.
8. Choose the required activity and click Finish.

Integrating the Samsung Pay SDK {#samsungpay-integrating-sdk}
=============================================================

1. Add the *samsungpay.jar* and *sdk-v1.0.0.jar* files to the *libs* folder of your Android project.

2. Choose Gradle Scripts \&gt; build.gradle and enter the dependencies shown below.

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   ```
   dependencies {
       compile files('libs/samsungpay.jar')
       compile files(libs/sdk-v1.0.0.jar')
   }          
   ```
3. Import the package.

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   ```
   import com.samsung.android.sdk.samsungpay;              
   ```

Using the API Key {#samsungpay-using-api-key}
=============================================

The API key is used to verify that your app (in debug mode or release mode) can use the Samsung Pay SDK APIs with the Samsung Pay application. To get the API key, you must create a *debug-api-key* file and include it in the *manifest* file.

1. To use the API key, include it in the *manifest* file with a custom tag. This enables the merchant app android *manifest* file to provide the `DebugMode`, `spay_debug_api_key` values as metadata.

Example: Debug Mode {#samsungpay-apikey-ex-debug}
=================================================

```
&lt;meta-data
    android:name="debug_mode"
    android:value="Y" /&gt;
&lt;meta-data
    android:name="spay_debug_api_key"
    android:value="asdfggkndkeie17283094858" /&gt;                                 
```

Example: Release Mode {#samsungpay_apikey_ex_release}
=====================================================

```
&lt;meta-data
    android:name="debug_mode"
    android:value="N" /&gt;                         
```

Verify That Your Application is Eligible for Samsung Pay {#samsungpay-initalize-for-app}
========================================================================================

You must initialize the *SSamsungPay* class to verify that your application is eligible for Samsung Pay and to display the Samsung Pay button to the customer (refer to branding guidelines).  
The *SSamsungPay* class provides the following API methods:

* `initialize()`---initializes the Samsung Pay SDK and verifies eligibility for Samsung Pay, including the device, software, and business area.

  > Request the ` initialize() ` API method of the *SSamsungPay* class before using the Samsung Pay SDK.

* `getVersionCode()`---retrieves the version number of the Samsung Pay SDK as an integer.

* `getVersionName()`---retrieves the version name of the Samsung Pay SDK as a string.
  {#samsungpay-initalize-for-app_ul_s5x_cdr_2pb}  
  After the `initialize()` API method request is successful, display the Samsung Pay button to the customer.  
  If the `initialize()` API method request fails, the method displays one of the following errors:

* `SsdkUnsupportedException`---the device is not a Samsung device or does not support the Samsung Pay package.

* `NullPointerException`---the context passed is null.
  {#samsungpay-initalize-for-app_ul_lnf_pdr_2pb}

Example: Samsung Pay Class {#samsungpay_ex_pay_class}
=====================================================

```
SSamsungPay spay = new SSamsungPay();
try {
    spay.initialize(mContext);
} catch (SsdkUnsupportedException e1) {
    e1.printStackTrace();
    pay_button.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
}                
```

Initiating a Payment {#samsungpay_initiating_payment}
=====================================================

You are required to use a specific transaction request structure and required fields to initiate a payment.

Required Fields for Initiating a Payment {#samsungpay-initiate-mandatory}
=========================================================================

The following fields are required for initiating a payment; include these fields in the `PaymentInfo` class:

> If the required fields are not included, you receive a ` NullPointerException ` error.

Example: Transaction Request Structure {#samsungpay-ex-txn-req-structure}
=========================================================================

```
private PaymentInfo makeTransactionDetails() {
// Supported card brands
ArrayList&lt;CardInfo.Brand&gt; brandList = new ArrayList&lt;CardInfo.Brand&gt;();
if (cardBrand.isChecked())
brandList.add(CardInfo.Brand.CARD);
if (mcBrand.isChecked())
brandList.add(CardInfo.Brand.Mastercard);
if (amexBrand.isChecked())
brandList.add(CardInfo.Brand.AMERICANEXPRESS);

// Basic payment information
PaymentInfo paymentReq = new PaymentInfo.Builder()
.setMerchantId(“merchantID”)
.setMerchantName("Test").setAmount(getAmount())
.setShippingAddress(getShippingAddressInfo())
.setOrderNumber(orderNoView.getText().toString())
.setPaymentProtocol(PaymentProtocol.PROTOCOL_3DS)
.setAddressInPaymentSheet(AddressInPaymentSheet.DO_NOT_SHOW)
.setAllowedCardBrands(brandList) .setRecurringEnabled(isRecurring)
.setCardHolderNameEnabled(isCardHolderNameRequired)
.build();
return paymentReq;
}

// Add shipping address details
private Address getShippingAddressInfo() {
Address address = new Address.Builder()
.setAddressee(name.getText().toString())
.setAddressLine1(addLine1.getText().toString())
.setAddressLine2(addline2.getText().toString())
.setCity(city.getText().toString())
.setState(state.getText().toString())
.setCountryCode(country.getSelectedItem().toString())
.setPostalCode(zip.getText().toString()).build(); return address;
}

// Add amount details private Amount getAmount() {
Amount amount = new Amount.Builder()
.setCurrencyCode(currencyType.getSelectedItem().toString())
.setItemTotalPrice(productPrice.getText().toString())
.setShippingPrice(shippingPrice.getText().toString())
.setTax(taxPrice.getText().toString())
.setTotalPrice(totalAmount.getText().toString()).build();
return amount;
}            
```

Requesting a Payment {#samsungpay-requesting-payment}
=====================================================

1. Use the `startSamsungPay()` API method in the `PaymentManager` class. The `PaymentManager` class includes the following API methods:

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   * `startSamsungPay()`---requests to initiate payment with Samsung Pay.
   * `updateAmount()`---updates the transaction amount if shipping address or card information is updated by Samsung Pay.
   * `updateAmountFailed()`---returns an error code when the new amount cannot be updated because of a wrong address.
2. Request the `startSamsungPay()` API method and include the following data:

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   * `PaymentInfo`---contains payment information.
   * `PID`---the product ID created in the Samsung Pay Partner Portal.
   * `StatusListener`---the result of the payment request is delivered to `StatusListener`. This listener should be registered before you call the `startSamsungPay()` API method.

   When you request the `startSamsungPay()` API method, the Samsung Pay online payment sheet is displayed on your application. The customer selects a registered card for payment and can also update the billing and shipping address.  
   The payment reply is delivered as one of the following events to `StatusListener`:

   * `onSuccess()`---this event is requested when Samsung Pay confirms the payment. It includes `encryptedPaymentCredential` in JSON format:
     * **method:** Payment protocol: 3-D Secure.
     * **merchant_ref:** Merchant reference code.
     * **billing_address.street**: Number, street name.
     * **billing_address.state_province:** Two-letter state code.
     * **billing_address.zip_postal_code:** Five-character zip code.
     * **billing_address.city:** City name.
     * **billing_address.county:**Two-letter country code.
     * **3ds.type:** `S` for Samsung Pay. Encrypted.
     * **3ds.version:** Current version `100`. Encrypted.
     * **3ds.data:** Base64-encoded payment data. Encrypted.
       {#samsungpay-requesting-payment_ul_wd1_dhr_2pb} Refer to the Samsung Pay developer website for information on how to decrypt the encrypted payment credential.

* `onFailure()`---this event is requested when the transaction fails. It returns an error code and error message.

Example: Request startSamsungPay() API Method {#samsungpay-ex-req-startsp-method}
=================================================================================

```
public void onPayButtonClicked(View v) {
    // Call startSamsungPay() method of PaymentManager class.
    // To create a transaction request for makeTransactionDetails() in
    the following code, see Example: Transaction Request Structure.
    try {
        mPaymentManager.startSamsungPay(makeTransactionDetails(), "enter
        product ID",
mStatusListener);
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

private PaymentManager.StatusListener mStatusListener = new
PaymentManager.StatusListener() {
    @Override
    public void onFailure(int errCode, String msg) {
        Log.d(TAG, " onFailed );
    }
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(PaymentInfo arg0, String result) {
        Log.d(TAG, "onSuccess ");
    };
