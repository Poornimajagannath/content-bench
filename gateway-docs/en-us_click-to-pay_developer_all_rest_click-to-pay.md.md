Introduction to the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` {#ctp-intro}
==========================================================

`Click to Pay Drop-In UI` powered by `Unified Checkout` provides an interface for easy acceptance of `Click to Pay` payments from Relay, Mastercard, and American Express cards. The `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` handles manual card entry for the non-`Click to Pay` payment schemes called out in this guide. Throughout this guide we refer to both *`Click to Pay Drop-In UI`* and *`Unified Checkout`.*  
`Click to Pay Drop-In UI` consists of a set of server-side APIs and a client-side JavaScript library.  
The server-side APIs authenticate your merchant identity, instruct the system to act within your payment environment, and provide a way to retrieve the payment data following a successful `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` interaction.  
The provided JavaScript library enables you to place a payment application within your e-commerce environment. This embedded component offers `Click to Pay` and card entry to your customers.  
Whether a customer uses a stored `Click to Pay` card or enters their payment information manually, the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` handles all user interactions and provides a response to your e-commerce system. All UI / UX must follow the UI/UX guidelines. For information about configuring your UI/UX, see [Click to Pay UI Examples](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-ui-screens/ctp-appendix-ui-ux-ex.md "").  
The `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` enables a portfolio to receive an encrypted payload and send a request to the API to retrieve the payment details. The format of the decrypted payment details are determined by the transaction type. The details are either a network token and cryptogram or the PAN, expiration details, and card verification value (CVV).  
The figures below shows the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` for a recognized user.

> IMPORTANT
> Each request that you send to ` Payment Gateway ` requires header information. For information about constructing the headers for your request, see the [*Getting Started with REST Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-about-guide.md "").

Browser Support

`Unified Checkout` supports these browser versions:

* Firefox 121
* GoogleChrome/Chium‑based browsers 118
* MicrosoftEdge 118
* Safari16

`Click to Pay` Customer Workflows {#ctp-walkthrough-intro}
==========================================================

This section provides an overview of the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` user experience. The `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` is designed to provide customers with a friction-free payment experience across many payment experiences. The user experience has been optimized for mobile use and performs equally well on mobile and desktop devices. `Click to Pay` recognizes customers as follows:
* The customer is a recognized `Click to Pay` customer.

* The customer is not recognized but is a `Click to Pay` customer.

* The customer is a guest at checkout.  
  These workflows show you the pages a customer encounters based on their status:

* [Recognized Click to Pay Customer](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-intro/ctp-walkthrough-intro/ctp-walkthrough-recognized.md "")

* [Unrecognized Click to Pay Customer](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-intro/ctp-walkthrough-intro/ctp-walkthrough-unrecognized.md "")

* [Guest Customer](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-intro/ctp-walkthrough-intro/ctp-walkthrough-guest.md "")

Recognized `Click to Pay` Customer {#ctp-walkthrough-recognized}
================================================================

This section provides an overview of the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` recognized experience. This interaction occurs when a customer's device is recognized by the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI`.  
A customer's device is recognized under these conditions:

* When the customer has used `Click to Pay` on their device through any `Click to Pay` channel.
* If the customer chose to have their device remembered during a previous transaction or when they enter their one-time password (OTP).
  The cardholder is presented with their stored `Click to Pay` cards in the UI when they are on a recognized device:

#### Figure: {#ctp-walkthrough-recognized_fig-ctp-recog-device}

Recognized `Click to Pay` Customer UI ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/ctp-recog-device-445x200.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Unrecognized `Click to Pay` Customer {#ctp-walkthrough-unrecognized}
====================================================================

This section provides an overview of the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` unrecognized experience. This interaction occurs when a customer's device is not recognized by the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI`. This condition occurs when the customer has a `Click to Pay` account but has not opted to have their details stored on the device. In this flow, the customer receives an OTP on their registered mobile device or their email address. The OTP can be received from any of the supported card networks, but will return cards that are stored in `Click to Pay` across all of the user's supported card networks. A Relay cardholder will receive an OTP to their registered email address and phone number to authenticate their identity. A Mastercard cardholder will receive an OTP on their registered phone number. After the user's identity is authenticated, their stored `Click to Pay` credentials are shown:

#### Figure: {#ctp-walkthrough-unrecognized_fig-ctp-recog-account}

Guest Customer {#ctp-walkthrough-guest}
=======================================

This section provides an overview of the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` guest experience. This interaction occurs when the customer has not previously created a `Click to Pay` account, or their issuer has not provisioned their card into `Click to Pay`.  
In the guest experience, `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` captures the PAN details and the cardholder chooses to create a `Click to Pay` account or to check out as a guest. In both cases, the payment credentials are available for processing transactions using your payment gateway.  
The cardholder can make a one-time payment or complete the payment and choose to create a `Click to Pay` account for future use using their chosen email address and phone number combination. A user can select Switch ID or Edit within the contact details tab in order to look up new payment details:

`Click to Pay Drop-In UI` Flow {#ctp_uc_getting_started_integration_flow}
=========================================================================

To integrate `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` into your platform, you must follow several integration steps. This section gives a high-level overview of how to integrate and launch `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` on your webpage and process a transaction. You can find the detailed specifications of the APIs later in this document.

1. You send a server-to-server API request for a capture context. This request is fully authenticated and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is necessary to invoke the frontend JavaScript library. For information on setting up the server side, see [Server-Side Set Up](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-getting-started-ss-setup.md "").
2. You invoke the `Unified Checkout` JavaScript library using the JWT response from the capture context request. For information on setting up the client side, see [Client-Side Set Up](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-getting-started-cs-setup-intro.md "").
3. You use the response from the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` to retrieve payment credentials for payment processing or other steps.
   This figure illustrates the system's payment flow.

Enabling `Click to Pay` in the `Business Center` {#uc-enable-digital-pay-ctp}
=============================================================================

To begin your integration, you must first enable `Click to Pay`. `Click to Pay` is a digital payment solution that allows customers to pay with their preferred card network and issuer without entering their card details on every website. Customers can use Relay, Mastercard, and American Express cards to streamline their purchase experience. `Click to Pay` provides a fast, secure, and consistent checkout experience across devices and browsers.  
Follow these steps to enable in `Click to Pay` on `Unified Checkout`:

1. Log in to the `Business Center`:  
   Test URL: ` `<https://businesscentertest.example.com/ebc2>` `  
   Production URL: ` `<https://businesscenter.example.com>` `  
   If you are unable to access this page, contact your sales representative. {#uc-enable-digital-pay-ctp_step-1}
   {#uc-enable-digital-pay-ctp_step-1}

2. In the `Business Center`, go to the left navigation panel and choose Payment Configuration \&gt; Unified Checkout. The `Unified Checkout` customer experience page appears:

   #### Figure:

   `Unified Checkout` Customer Experience ![Image that shows the Unified Checkout Customer
   Experience page.](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/uc-custom-exp-800x875.png/jcr:content/renditions/original) {#uc-enable-digital-pay-ctp_step-2}
   {#uc-enable-digital-pay-ctp_step-2}

3. In the Payment Options section, click **Manage**. The Payment Options page appears.

4. Click **Manage** next to `Click to Pay`. The `Click to Pay` configuration page appears.

5. Enter your business name and website URL.

6. Click Submit.

   > IMPORTANT
   > ` Click to Pay ` uses network tokenization for transactions. These network tokens are stored in the vault of the token requestor ID (TRID) for the card scheme.

Server-Side Set Up {#ctp-getting-started-ss-setup}
==================================================

This section contains the information you need to set up your server. Initializing `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` within your webpage begins with a server-to-server call to the sessions API. This step authenticates your merchant credentials, and establishes how the frontend components will function. The sessions API request contains parameters that define how the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` performs.  
The server-side component provides this information:

* A transaction-specific public key that is used by the customer's browser to protect the transaction.
* An authenticated context description package that manages the payment experience on the client side. It includes available payment options such as card networks, payment interface styling, and interaction methods.

{#ctp-getting-started-ss-setup_ul_atq_bwq_npb}  
The functions are compiled in a JSON Web Token (JWT) object referred to as the *capture context* . For information JSON Web Tokens, see [JSON Web Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/Appendix/ctp-appendix-jwts.md "").

Capture Context Using the Sessions API {#ctp-capture-context-intro}
===================================================================

This section contains the information you need to set up your server. Initializing `Unified Checkout` within your webpage begins with a server-to-server call to the Sessions API. This step authenticates your merchant credentials, and establishes how the frontend components will function. The Sessions API request contains parameters that define how `Unified Checkout` performs.  
The server-side component provides this information:

* A transaction-specific public key is used by the customer's browser to protect the transaction.
* An authenticated context description package that manages the payment experience on the client side. It includes available payment options such as card networks, payment interface styling, and payment methods.

The functions are compiled in a JSON Web Token (JWT) object referred to as the *capture context*.  
For information on JWTs see [JSON Web Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-appendix-jwts.md ""). The capture context request is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) that includes all of the merchant-specific parameters. This request tells the frontend JavaScript library how to behave within your payment experience. The request provides authentication, one-time keys, the target origin to the `Unified Checkout` integration in addition to allowed card networks and payment types. The capture context request includes these elements:
* allowedCardNetworks
* allowedPaymentTypes
* clientVersion
* targetOrigin
  Use the targetOrigins and the allowedPaymentTypes fields to define the target origin and the accepted digital payment methods in your capture context.  
  When you configure the merchant settings using the Merchant Experience section of the `Business Center`, your request to the `sessions` API must include these required fields. All other values are determined from the settings that are configured in the `Business Center`:

```
{
  "targetOrigins": ["https://merchant.com", "https://reseller.com:8443"],
  "locale": "en_US",
  "country": "US",
    "data": {
        "orderInformation": {
          "amountDetails": {
            "totalAmount": "21.00",
            "currency": "USD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

{#ctp-capture-context-intro_codeblock_kxt_pcj_2jc}  
When you use only the sessions API to generate the capture context, your request must include these required fields:

```
{
  "targetOrigins": [
    "https://yourCheckoutPage.com"
  ],
  "allowedCardNetworks": [
    "CARD",
    "MASTERCARD",
    "AMEX"
  ],
  "allowedPaymentTypes": [
    "CLICKTOPAY"
  ],
  "country": "US",
  "locale": "en_US",
  "captureMandate": {
    "billingType": "FULL",
    "requestEmail": true,
    "requestPhone": true,
    "requestShipping": true,
    "shipToCountries": [
      "US",
      "GB"
    ],
    "showAcceptedNetworkIcons": true
  },
  "data": {
    "orderInformation": {
      "amountDetails": {
        "totalAmount": "21.00",
        "currency": "USD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

{#ctp-capture-context-intro_codeblock_nfk_rcj_2jc}  
For information about requesting the capture context using the `sessions` API, see the [API Reference](https://developer.example.com/api-reference-assets/index.md#unified-checkout "") in the `Payment Gateway` Developer Center. For more information on requesting the capture context, see [Sessions API - Capture Context](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-setup-capture-context.md "").

Client-Side Set Up {#ctp-getting-started-cs-setup-intro}
========================================================

This section contains the information you need to set up the client side. You use the `Unified Checkout` JavaScript library to integrate with your e-commerce website. It has two primary components:

* The button widget, which presents `Click to Pay` to the customer. There are different options available to display this to your customers. See these topics: XXX
* The payment acceptance page, which captures payment information from the cardholder. You can embed the payment acceptance page within your webpage or add it as a sidebar.

The `Unified Checkout` JavaScript library supports `Click to Pay` and manual card entry payment methods.  
Follow these steps to set up the client:

1. Load the JavaScript library.
2. Initialize the accept object the capture context JWT. For information JSON Web Tokens, see [JSON Web Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/Appendix/ctp-appendix-jwts.md "").
3. Initialize the unified payment object with optional parameters.
4. Show the button list or payment acceptance page or both.

{#ctp-getting-started-cs-setup-intro_ul_m5t_gwq_npb}  
The response to these interactions is a transient token that you use to retrieve the payment information captured by the UI.

Loading the JavaScript Library and Invoking the Accept Function {#ctp-getting-started-cs-js-library-intro}
==========================================================================================================

Use the client library asset path and client library integrity value that is returned by the capture context response to invoke `Unified Checkout` on your page.  
You can retrieve these values from the clientLibrary and clientLibraryIntegrity fields that are returned in the JWT from POST `https://api.example.com``/uc/v1/sessions`. You can use these values to create your script tags.  
You must perform this process for each transaction, as these values may be unique for each transaction. You must avoid hard-coding values for the clientLibrary and clientLibraryIntegrity fields to prevent client-side errors.  
For example, a response from `https://apitest.example.com``/uc/v1/sessions` would include:

```
"data": {
    "clientLibrary":"[EXTRACT clientLibrary VALUE from here]",
    "clientLibraryIntegrity": "[EXTRACT clientLibraryIntegrity VALUE from here]"
}
```

Below is an example script tag:

```
&lt;script src="[INSERT clientLibrary VALUE HERE]" 
    integrity=”[INSERT clientLibraryIntegrity VALUE HERE]”
    crossorigin=”anonymous”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

> IMPORTANT
> Use the clientLibrary and clientLibraryIntegrity parameter values in the capture context response to obtain the ` Unified Checkout ` JavaScript library URL and the integrity value. This ensures that you are always using the most up-to-date library and protects against fraud. Do not hard-code the ` Unified Checkout ` JavaScript library URL or integrity value.  
> When you load the library, the capture context from your initial server-side request is used to invoke the accept function.

JavaScript Example: Initializing the SDK {#ctp-getting-started-cs-js-library-example}
=====================================================================================

```
async function launchCheckout() {
  try {
	const client = await VAS.UnifiedCheckout(sessionJWT);
	const checkout = await client.createCheckout({ autoProcessing: false }); 
	const token = await checkout.mount('#buttons');
    // result contains the Transient Token
    // Send result to your server for retrieval of payment information
    sendToServer(token);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === 'UnifiedCheckoutError') {
      handleError(error.reason, error.message);
    }
  } finally {
    checkout.destroy();
    client.destroy();
  }
}

launchCheckout();
```

{#ctp-getting-started-cs-js-library-example_codeblock_qsv_chn_djc}  
In this example, `sessionJWT` refers to the capture context JWT.

JavaScript Example: Displaying the Button List {#ctp-getting-started-cs-js-button-example}
==========================================================================================

After you initialize the `Unified Checkout` object, you can add the payment application and payment acceptance pages to your webpage. You can attach the embedded `Unified Checkout` tool and payment acceptance pages to any named element within your HTML. Typically, they are attached to explicit named components that are replaced with `Unified Checkout`'s iframes.

```
// Sidebar
const result = await checkout.mount('#buttons');

// Embedded
const result = await checkout.mount({
  paymentSelection: '#buttons',
  paymentScreen: '#form'
});
```

{#ctp-getting-started-cs-js-button-example_codeblock_fpp_pb1_2jc}

JavaScript Example: Client-Defined Trigger for `Click to Pay` or PAN Entry {#ctp-getting-started-cs-js-trigger-ctp-pan-example}
===============================================================================================================================

When you display `CLICKTOPAY` or `PANENTRY` as allowed payment types, you can load the UI without displaying the `Unified Checkout` checkout button. You can do this by creating a trigger that defines what event loads the UI.  
You can create a trigger only for `CLICKTOPAY` or `PANENTRY` payment methods:

```
//PAN Entry

const trigger = client.createTrigger('PANENTRY');

//Click to Pay

const trigger = client.createTrigger('CLICKTOPAY');
```

{#ctp-getting-started-cs-js-trigger-ctp-pan-example_codeblock_ffr_qb1_2jc} IMPORTANT
When you use the ` client.createTrigger() ` method for ` Click to Pay `, you must create a custom UI to trigger ` Click to Pay `. See [Click to Pay UI Examples](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-ui-screens/ctp-appendix-ui-ux-ex.md "").

Adding the Payment Application and Payment Acceptance {#ctp-getting-started-button-widget-intro}
================================================================================================

After you initialize the `Unified Checkout` object, you can add the payment application and payment acceptance pages to your webpage. You can attach the `Unified Checkout` embedded tool and payment acceptance pages to any named element within your HTML. Typically, they are attached to explicit named `&lt;div&gt;` components that are replaced with `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` `iframes`.
IMPORTANT If you do not specify a location for the payment acceptance page, it is placed in the sidebar.

JavaScript Example: Setting Up with Full Sidebar {#ctp-getting-started-button-widget-sidebar}
=============================================================================================

```
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script
    src="[INSERT clientLibrary VALUE HERE]"
    integrity="[INSERT clientLibraryIntegrity VALUE HERE]”
    crossorigin=”anonymous"
  &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Unified Checkout Integration&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;input
    type="hidden"
    name="sessionJWT"
    value="[INSERT sessionJWT HERE]"
  /&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    const sessionJWT = document.getElementById("sessionJWT").value;
    
    async function launchCheckout() {
      try {
        const client = await VAS.UnifiedCheckout(sessionJWT);
        const checkout = await client.createCheckout();
        const result = await checkout.mount('#payment-buttons');

        // result contains the completed payment result JWT
        // Send result to your server for verification
        sendToServer(result);
      } catch (error) {
        if (error.name === 'UnifiedCheckoutError') {
          handleError(error.reason, error.message);
        }
      } finally {
        checkout.destroy();
        client.destroy();
      }
    }

    launchCheckout();
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

JavaScript Example: Setting Up with the Embedded Component {#ctp-getting-started-button-widget-embedded}
========================================================================================================

The main difference between using an embedded component and the sidebar is that the `VAS.UnifiedCheckout(sessionJWT)` object is set to `false`, and the location of the payment screen is passed in the containers argument.

> IMPORTANT If you do not specify a location for the payment acceptance page, it is placed in the side bar.

```
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script
    src="[INSERT clientLibrary VALUE HERE]"
    integrity="[INSERT clientLibraryIntegrity VALUE HERE]"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Unified Checkout Integration&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;input
    type="hidden"
    id="sessionJWT"
    name="sessionJWT"
    value="[INSERT sessionJWT HERE]"
  /&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    const sessionJWT = document.getElementById("sessionJWT").value;

    async function launchCheckout() {
      let client;
      let checkout;

      try {
        client = await VAS.UnifiedCheckout(sessionJWT);
        checkout = await client.createCheckout();
        const result = await checkout.mount('#payment-buttons');

        // result contains the completed payment result JWT
        // Send result to your server for verification
        sendToServer(result);
      } catch (error) {
        if (error.name === 'UnifiedCheckoutError') {
          handleError(error.reason, error.message);
        }
      } finally {
        if (checkout) {
          checkout.destroy();
        }

        if (client) {
          client.destroy();
        }
      }
    }

    launchCheckout();
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

{#ctp-getting-started-button-widget-embedded_codeblock_ugy_tb1_2jc}

Sessions API - Capture Context {#ctp-setup-capture-context}
===========================================================

This section contains the information you need to request the capture context using the `sessions` API. The capture context request contains all of the merchant-specific parameters that tell the frontend JavaScript library how to behave within your payment experience.  
The capture context is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) containing this information:

* Merchant-specific parameters that dictate the customer payment experience for the current payment transaction.
* A one-time public key that secures the information flow during the current payment transaction.

The capture context request includes these elements:

* allowedCardNetworks
* allowedPaymentTypes
* clientVersion
* targetOrigins  
  For information on JSON Web Tokens, see [JSON Web Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/Appendix/ctp-appendix-jwts.md "").

Target Origin
:
The [target origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin "") is defined by the scheme (protocol), hostname (domain) and port number (if used).

    You must use the https:// protocol. Sub domains must also be included in the target origin.

    Any valid top-level domains, such as .com, .co.uk, and .gov.br, are supported. Wildcards are not supported.

    For example, if you are launching `Click to Pay` on example.com, the target origin could be any of the following:

    * [https://example.com](https://example.com/ "")
    * [https://subdomain.example.com](https://subdomain.example.com/ "")
    * [https://example.com:8080](https://example.com:8080/ "")

:
You can supply up to seven origins within the targetOrigins field for nested iframes. To do this, you must do the following:

    * Compare the list of origins in the `v1/sessions` targetOrigins field against the location.ancestorOrigins of the browser.
    * Ensure that the count of origins and their content matches in the targetOrigins field against the location.ancestorOrigins of the browser. If any origins are missing or mismatched, the system prevents `Unified Checkout` from loading and displays a client-side error message.
    {#ctp-setup-capture-context_ul_ijc_2tj_2jc}

    You must::

Allowed Card Networks
:
Use the allowedCardNetworks field to define the card types. `Click to Pay` supports American Express, Mastercard, and Relay. The `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` manually captures the other card types that are listed in the capture context request. This enables you to process the payment through the chosen gateway but the cardholder is not able to enroll these cards in `Click to Pay`.

    These card networks are available for card entry:

    * American Express
    * Carnet
    * Cartes Bancaires
    * China UnionPay
    * Diners Club
    * Discover
    * EFTPOS
    * ELO
    * Jaywan
    * JCB
    * KCP
    * mada
    * Maestro
    * Mastercard
    * Meeza
    * PayPak
    * UATP
    * Relay

    To support dual-branded or co-badged cards, you must list your supported card types values for the allowedCardNetworks field based on your preference for processing card numbers. For example, if a card is dual-branded as Relay and EFTPOS and EFTPOS is listed first, the card type is set to EFTPOS after the card number is entered in your `Unified Checkout` card collection form. For information on dual-branded or co-badged cards, see [Dual-Branded Cards](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-tokens-intro/ctp-dual-co-brand-card-support.md "").

    When a Cartes Bancaires dual-branded card is entered in the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI`, the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` provides a radio selector button to enable the cardholder to select which scheme they want to use to process the payment. The radio selector defaults to the card scheme that appears first in the allowedCardNetworks field.

    Cartes Bancaires is not supported for `Click to Pay`. If a cardholder selects to process a payment with Cartes Bancaires it is processed as a one-time guest checkout and the user is not enrolled in `Click to Pay`. If a cardholder chooses to process with Relay or Mastercard instead of Cartest Bancaires, they are given the option to enroll their card in `Click to Pay`.

:
> IMPORTANT
> Some card types, such as KCP and UATP, do not have security codes (CVV or CVN). If you include only card types that do not have security codes in the allowedCardNetworks field, ` Unified Checkout ` does not display the security code field in the UI.  
> If you include card types that do not have security codes and cards types that do have security codes in the allowedCardNetworks field, ` Unified Checkout ` displays the security code field in the UI. The field is disabled in the UI when the cardholder enters a card number for a card type with no security code.

Include Card Prefix
:
You can control the length of the card number prefix to be received in the response to the capture context `/sessions` request:

    * 6 digits
    * 8 digits
    * no prefix at all


    > IMPORTANT
    > When you request the card number prefix for a ` Click to Pay ` tokenized credential, 6 digits are returned. ` Click to Pay ` does not return 8 digits.
    To specify your preferred card number prefix length, include or exclude the transientTokenResponseOptions.includeCardPrefix field in the capture context `/sessions` request.

:
**If you want to receive a 6-digit card number prefix in the response**

    * Do not include the transientTokenResponseOptions.includeCardPrefix field in the capture context `/sessions` request.
    * This example shows how a 6-digit card number prefix `411111` is returned in the transient token response:

      ```
      "maskedValue" : "XXXXXXXXXXXX1111”,
                          "bin" : "411111"
      ```

:
**If you want to receive an 8-digit card number prefix in the response**

    * Include the transientTokenResponseOptions.includeCardPrefix field in the capture context request, and set the value to `true`. IMPORTANT
      > Per PCI DSS requirements, this requirement applies only to card numbers longer than 15 digits and for Discover, JCB, Mastercard, UnionPay, and Relay brands.
      > * If the card type entered is not part of these brands, a 6-digit card number prefix is returned instead.
      > * If the card type entered is not part of these brands but is *co-branded* with these brands, an 8-digit card number prefix is returned.
    * This example shows how an 8-digit card prefix `41111102` is returned in the transient token response:

      ```
      "maskedValue" : "XXXXXXXXXXXX1111”,
                          "prefix" : "41111102"
      ```

:
**If you do not want to receive a card number prefix in the response**

    * Include the transientTokenResponseOptions.includeCardPrefix field in the capture context request, and set the value to `false`.
    * This example shows how a card number is returned without a card number prefix in the transient token response:

      ```
      "maskedValue" : "XXXXXXXXXXXX1111"
      ```

:
**Best practice:** If your application does not require card number prefix information for routing or identification purposes, `Payment Gateway` recommends that you include the transientTokenResponseOptions.includeCardPrefix field in the capture context request and set its value to `false`. Doing so limits the exposure of payment data to only what is necessary for your processing needs.  
For more information about PCI DSS, see [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/What-are-acceptable-formats-for-truncation-of-primary-account-numbers "") on the PCI Security Standards Council site.

Allowed Payment Types
:
You can specify the type of `Unified Checkout` digital payment methods that you want to accept in the capture context.
:
Use the allowedPaymentTypes field to define the payment type. The `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` accepts these payment types:

    * `CLICKTOPAY`
    * `PANENTRY`


    > IMPORTANT
    > When you include ` CLICKTOPAY `, it supports both ` Click to Pay ` and ` PANENTRY ` in the UI.

> IMPORTANT
> When integrating with ` Payment Gateway ` APIs, ` Payment Gateway ` insists that you dynamically parse the response for the fields that you are looking for. Additional fields may be added in the future.  
> You must ensure that your integration can handle new fields that are returned in the response. While the underlying data structures will not change, you must also ensure that your integration can handle changes to the order in which the data is returned.

Features {#ctp-capture-context-features}
========================================

This section includes information on the features that are supported in `Click to Pay`.

Allowed Card Networks {#ctp-cc-allowed-card-networks}
=====================================================

Use the allowedCardNetworks field to define the card types.  
These card networks are available for card entry:

* American Express (supported on `Click to Pay`)
* Cartes Bancaires
* Carnet
* China UnionPay
* Diners Club
* Discover
* EFTPOS
* ELO
* Jaywan
* JCB
* JCrew
* KCP
* mada
* Maestro
* Mastercard (supported on `Click to Pay`)
* Meeza
* PayPak
* UATP
* Relay (supported on `Click to Pay`)
  {#ctp-cc-allowed-card-networks_ul_cz5_tt1_3jc}  
  To support dual-branded or co-badged cards, you must list your supported card type values for the allowedCardNetworks field based on your preference for processing card numbers. For example, if a card is dual-branded as Relay and Cartes Bancaires, and Cartes Bancaires is listed first, the card type is set to Cartes Bancaires after the card number is entered in your `Unified Checkout` card collection form. For information on dual-branded or co-badged cards, see [Dual-Branded Cards](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-tokens-intro/ctp-dual-co-brand-card-support.md "").

> IMPORTANT  
> Some card types, such as KCP and UATP, do not have security codes (CVV or CVN). If you include only card types that do not have security codes in the allowedCardNetworks field, ` Unified Checkout ` does not display the security code field in the UI.  
> If you include card types that do not have security codes and cards types that do have security codes in the allowedCardNetworks field, ` Unified Checkout ` displays the security code field in the UI. The field is disabled in the UI when the cardholder enters a card number for a card type with no security code

Target Origins {#ctp-cc-target-origin}
======================================

The [target origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin "") is defined by the scheme (protocol), hostname (domain), and port number (if used).  
You must use the https:// protocol. Sub domains must also be included in the target origin.  
Any valid top-level domains, such as .com, .co.uk, and .gov.br, are supported. Wildcards are not supported.  
For example, if you are launching `Unified Checkout` on example.com, the target origin could be any of the following:

* [https://example.com](https://example.com/ "")
* [https://subdomain.example.com](https://subdomain.example.com/ "")
* [https://example.com:8080](https://example.com:8080/ "")

{#ctp-cc-target-origin_ul_plq_qt1_3jc}  
When you use `Unified Checkout` in an iframe, you must include the domain for the URL that loads the iframe and the iframe URL in the targetOrigins field.

Allowed Payment Types {#ctp-cc-allowed-pay-type}
================================================

You can specify the type of `Unified Checkout` digital payment methods that you want to accept in the capture context.  
Use the allowedPaymentTypes field to define the payment type:

* `CLICKTOPAY`
* `PANENTRY`

{#ctp-cc-allowed-pay-type_ul_s5z_4t1_3jc} IMPORTANT
` Click to Pay ` accepts American Express, Mastercard, and Relay for saved cards. Relay and Mastercard tokenize payment credentials using network tokenization for all ` Click to Pay ` requests. ` Click to Pay ` uses ` Click to Pay ` Token Requester IDs (TRIDs) rather than your existing TRIDs to generate network tokens.  
For more information on enabling and managing `Click to Pay`, see [Enabling Click to Pay in the Business Center](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-uc-getting-started-integration-flow/ctp-enable-digital-pay-intro/uc-enable-digital-pay-ctp.md "").

Auto-check Enrollment {#ctp-cc-ctp-enroll-precheck}
===================================================

You can have the `Click to Pay` box pre-checked when a user is manually entering their card details and `Click to Pay` is enabled. The customer can uncheck the box if necessary, which means the request is processed as a one-time manual PAN transaction. This is available when you set the billingType field to `PARTIAL` or `FULL` in the capture context. This ensures that the customer's billing country can be validated in the UI.  
`Click to Pay` enrollment pre-check is available in these countries:

* Argentina
* Brazil
* Chile
* Colombia
* Kuwait
* Mexico
* Peru
* Qatar
* Saudi Arabia
* South Africa
* Ukraine
* United Arab Emirates
  {#ctp-cc-ctp-enroll-precheck_ul_znq_st1_3jc}

```
"paymentConfigurations": {
    "CLICKTOPAY": {
      "autoCheckEnrollment": true
    }
  }
```

{#ctp-cc-ctp-enroll-precheck_codeblock_a4q_st1_3jc}

Button Type {#ctp-cc-button-type}
=================================

When `Unified Checkout` loads, the payment buttons displayed are based on what you include in the allowedPaymentTypes object in the capture context. `Unified Checkout` enables you to customize the text on the payment buttons. You can do this by setting the buttonType field object in the capture context to one of these values:

* `ADD_CARD`
* `CARD_PAYMENT`
* `CHECKOUT_AND_CONTINUE`
* `DEBIT_CREDIT`
* `DONATE`
* `PAY`
* `PAY_WITH_CARD`
* `SUBSCRIBE_WITH_CARD`
  {#ctp-cc-button-type_ul_flz_5t1_3jc}  
  If you do not include the buttonType field in your request, the payment button text defaults to **Checkout with card**. For example:  
  ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/uc-checkout-card-300x100.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Customize Button Text {#ctp-session-button-text}
================================================

Use the buttonType field to customize the text on payment buttons:

|    buttonType Value     |  Button Display Text  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| `ADD_CARD`              | Add card              |
| `CARD_PAYMENT`          | Card payment          |
| `CHECKOUT_AND_CONTINUE` | Checkout and continue |
| `DEBIT_CREDIT`          | Debit or credit       |
| `DONATE`                | Donate                |
| `PAY`                   | Pay                   |
| `PAY_WITH_CARD`         | Pay with card         |
| `SUBSCRIBE_WITH_CARD`   | Subscribe with card   |
[Button Text Options]

When you do not include this field in your request, the default button text is "Checkout with card."

Capture Mandate {#ctp-cc-capture-mandate}
=========================================

The capture mandate enables you to define which fields are captured within `Unified Checkout`. You must include the fields and set the values in the capture context based on the information that you want `Unified Checkout` to collect. This enables the cardholder to review and edit their details where the UI includes these fields. When the UI is used to capture cardholder information, all captured information is available within the payment details API response. When you want the cardholder to review existing address data, you can include the known customer data in the capture context and this information is pre-filled in the `Unified Checkout` UI. For information about the payment details API, see [Payment Details API](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-token-get-pymnt-details.md "").

captureMandate.comboCard {#ctp-cc-capture-combo-cards}
======================================================

A combo card is a single card in Brazil that functions as both a debit and a credit card. `Unified Checkout` enables the cardholder to choose whether to pay for a transaction using a debit or credit card. The cardholder can choose the card that they want to use when they enter their card details or when they choose a stored Relay card from their `Click to Pay` wallet during checkout. While in the card details section of the payment form, the cardholder is prompted for a debit or credit card. Credit is the default option.  
To enable combo cards during checkout, you must include the comboCard field in your capture context request and set the field value to `true`. When the comboCard field value is set to `true`, the option to use a debit or credit card appears for all Relay cards that are entered in Unified Checkout and for all cards that are already stored in `Click to Pay`. If you do not want to offer a combo card at checkout, do not include the comboCard field in your capture context request:

```
"captureMandate" : {
      "comboCard": true
}
```

{#ctp-cc-capture-combo-cards_codeblock_dmg_4r1_3jc} IMPORTANT This feature is available only in Brazil.

captureMandate.CPF {#ctp-cc-capture-cpf}
========================================

The Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas (CPF) Brazilian tax ID feature is for customers in Brazil and provides your customers with a way to include their Consumer National Identifier when it is requested at checkout. Include this field in the capture context to display this field within the flow for manual card entry and `Click to Pay` transactions:

```
"captureMandate" : {
    "CPF": {
        "required": true
    }
}
```

{#ctp-cc-capture-cpf_codeblock_g2p_lr1_3jc}
IMPORTANT This feature is available only in Brazil.

captureMandate.requestSaveCredentials {#ctp-cc-capture-save-card}
=================================================================

This feature enables you to display a consent option in the `Unified Checkout` UI for the cardholder to save their payment details for future use.  
When you use this field without using the complete mandate, the transient token payload includes the consumerPreference.saveCard field with the value set to `true` when the cardholder has checked to save the payment information for future purchases:

```
"captureMandate" : {
      "requestSaveCredentials": true
}
```

{#ctp-cc-capture-save-card_codeblock_y3r_ht1_3jc}

captureMandate.showConfirmationStep {#ctp-cc-capture-rem-confirm-screen}
========================================================================

When showConfirmstionStep is set to `false`, you can remove the final summary confirmation screens from the checkout experience. When the UI displays cardholder data, the cardholder can review and, if necessary, edit their payment details before checkout is complete.

```
{
  "captureMandate": {
    "showConfirmationStep": false
  }
}
```

{#ctp-cc-capture-rem-confirm-screen_codeblock_fj1_151_3jc}

captureMandate.billingType {#ctp-cc-capture-billing-type}
=========================================================

`PARTIAL`: Only the billing postal code and billing country are collected in the UI. Set to this value when you use relaxed address verification services (AVS). This includes markets where postal code and billing country are enough for successful payment processing.  
`NONE`: No fields are shown in the UI to capture cardholder billing details. If you are using the Complete Mandate, you must provide billing details in the capture context. All information that is collected from these fields is tokenized in the transient token and sent for payment processing. For information about which fields are required for payment processing, see the [Payments Developer Guide](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-intro.md "").  
`FULL`: These fields are shown in the UI to capture cardholder billing details. When you include the billing details in the capture context, these details are pre-filled in the `Unified Checkout` UI. All information that is collected from these fields are tokenized in the transient token and sent for payment processing where the Complete Mandate is used.

captureMandate.requestEmail {#ctp-cc-capture-req-email}
=======================================================

`false`: No email address is shown in the UI. If you are using `Click to Pay`, this email address is used to find the cardholder's `Click to Pay` account and it appears in the UI when requestEmail is set to `false`.  
`true`: The email address is shown and captured in the UI. If you are using `Click to Pay`, this email address is used to find the cardholder's `Click to Pay` account.

captureMandate.requestPhone {#ctp-cc-capture-req-phone}
=======================================================

`false`: No phone number is shown or captured in the UI.  
`true`: The phone number is shown and captured in the UI.

captureMandate.requestShipping {#ctp-cc-capture-req-ship}
=========================================================

`false`: No shipping information is captured in the UI. When shipping details are required for payment processing and are used for follow on services such as `Decision Manager`, you can include these fields in the capture context. These details are tokenized and passed through.  
`true`: Shipping fields are shown in the UI and are collected by `Unified Checkout`. When you include the shipping details in the capture context, the information appears prefilled in the UI.

captureMandate.shipToCountries {#ctp-cc-capture-ship-to}
========================================================

When the requestShipping field is set to `true`, only the countries that are included in this field can be selected by the cardholder for their shipping address.

Include Card Prefix {#ctp-cc-include-prefix}
============================================

You can control the length of the card number prefix to be received in the response to the capture context `/sessions` request:

* Six digits
* Eight digits
* No prefix

{#ctp-cc-include-prefix_ul_cjr_xt1_3jc}To specify your preferred card number prefix length, include or exclude the transientTokenResponseOptions.includeCardPrefix field in the capture context `/sessions` request.  
To receive a six-digit card number prefix in the response, follow this step:  
Do not include the transientTokenResponseOptions.includeCardPrefix field in the capture context `/sessions` request.  
This example shows how a six-digit card number prefix `411111` is returned in the transient token response:

```
"maskedValue" : "XXXXXXXXXXXX1111”,
                        "bin" : "411111"
```

{#ctp-cc-include-prefix_codeblock_djr_xt1_3jc}  
To receive an eight-digit card number prefix in the response, follow this step:  
Include the transientTokenResponseOptions.includeCardPrefix field in the capture context request, and set the value to `true`. IMPORTANT

> This PCI DSS requirement applies only to card numbers longer than 15 digits and only for Discover, JCB, Mastercard, UnionPay, and Relay brands.
>
> * If the card type entered is not part of these brands, a six-digit card number prefix is returned instead.
> * If the card type entered is not part of these brands but is *co-branded* with these brands, an eight-digit card number prefix is returned.
>   {#ctp-cc-include-prefix_ul_fjr_xt1_3jc}
>   This example shows how an eight-digit card prefix `41111102` is returned in the transient token response:

```
"maskedValue" : "XXXXXXXXXXXX1111”,
                        "prefix" : "41111102"
```

{#ctp-cc-include-prefix_codeblock_gjr_xt1_3jc}  
To not receive a card number prefix in the response, follow this step:  
Include the transientTokenResponseOptions.includeCardPrefix field in the capture context request, and set the value to `false`.  
This example shows how a card number is returned without a card number prefix in the transient token response:

```
"maskedValue" : "XXXXXXXXXXXX1111"
```

{#ctp-cc-include-prefix_codeblock_hjr_xt1_3jc}
**Best practice:** If your application does not require card number prefix information for routing or identification, `Payment Gateway` recommends that you include the transientTokenResponseOptions.includeCardPrefix field in the capture context request and set its value to `false`. Doing so limits the exposure of payment data to only what is necessary for your processing needs.  
For more information about PCI DSS, see [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/What-are-acceptable-formats-for-truncation-of-primary-account-numbers "") on the PCI Security Standards Council site.

Email Autolookup {#ctp-cc-email-autolookup}
===========================================

When you include `Click to Pay` as an allowedPaymentType, an automatic email lookup occurs when an email address is included in the capture context request in the data.billTo.email field.. If the user has a `Click to Pay` account but is not on a recognized device, a one-time password (OTP) screen appears and the user is prompted to enter their OTP. If the user does not have a `Click to Pay` account, the user must enter their card information manually. They will have the option to create a `Click to Pay` account.

Mobile as Identity for `Click to Pay` {#ctp-cc-mobile-identity}
===============================================================

`Click to Pay` supports mobile numbers as way to identify a user. This enables cardholders to use their mobile number instead of their email address in certain markets for Relay and Mastercard transactions.  
When the requestEmail field is set to `false` and the requestPhone field is set to `true`, the cardholder is identified using the provided mobile number. When the requestEmail field is set to `true` and the requestPhone field is set to `false`, the cardholder is identified using the provided email address. When the requestEmail field is set to `true` and the requestPhone field is also set to `true`, the cardholder is identified using the provided email address first and then the mobile number if there is no match.

UI/UX Customization Look and Feel {#ctp-cc-ui-ux-look-feel}
===========================================================

UI/UX Customization Look and Feel
`Click to Pay Drop-In UI` supports appearance customization using the appearance field object. You can customize the theme, button configuration, color styling, input states, and typography. All customization fields are optional and can be configured in the API in the appearance.variables field object. For a complete list of customizable fields, see [Customization Matrix](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/Appendix/ctp-appendix-cust-matrix.md "").  
This is an example JSON configuration:

```
{ 
  "appearance": { 
    "theme": "LIGHT", 
    "buttonType": "CHECKOUT", 
    "variables": { 
      "backgroundColor": "#FFFFFF",

Validating the Capture Context {#uc-validate-capture-context-intro}
===================================================================

The capture context that you generate is a JSON Web Token (JWT) data object. The JWT is digitally signed using a public key and confirms the validity of the JWT and that it comes from `Payment Gateway`. When you do not have a key in the JWT header, `Payment Gateway` recommends that you follow cryptography best practices and validate the capture context signature.  
To validate a JWT, you must obtain its public key. This public RSA key is in JSON Web Key (JWK) format. The public key is associated with the capture context on the `Payment Gateway` domain.  
To get the public key of a capture context from the header of the capture context itself, you must retrieve the key ID associated with the public key and then pass the key ID to the `/flex/v2/public-keys` endpoint:

1. From the header of the capture context, get the key ID (kid):

   ```
   {
       "kid": "3g",
       "alg": "RS256"
   }
   ```
2. Send a GET request to the `/flex/v2/public-keys` endpoint and include the key ID. For example:

   * **Test:** `GET ``https://apitest.example.com``/flex/v2/public-keys/{3g}`
   * **Production:** `GET ``https://api.example.com``/flex/v2/public-keys/{3g}`
   * **Production in Saudi Arabia:** `GET ``https://api.sa.example.com``/flex/v2/public-keys/{3g}`
   * **Test in Saudi Arabia:** `GET ``https://apitest.sa.example.com``/flex/v2/public-keys/{3g}`  
     Depending on the cryptographic method you use to validate the public key, you might need to convert the key to privacy-enhanced mail (PEM) format.
3. The resource returns the public key:

   ```

   Use this public RSA key to validate the capture context.

4. Parse the JWT capture context to get the kid from its header:

   ```
   {
       "kid": "3g",
       "alg": "RS256"
   }
   ```
5. Send a GET request to retrieve the public key from `/flex/v2/public-keys/3g`:

   ```
   {
       "kty":"RSA",    
       "use":"enc",
       "kid":"3g",
       "n":"ir7Nl1Bj8G9rxr3co5v_JLkP3o9UxXZRX1LIZFZeckguEf7Gdt5kGFFfTsymKBesm3Pe

        "e":"AQAB"
   }
   ```

Session Validation {#uc-session-validate}
=========================================

The session JWT is digitally signed using RS256. You must confirm that it was issued by `Payment Gateway` and has not been tampered with. Follow these steps to validate the signature:

1. Parse the session JWT header to extract the key ID (`kid`):

   ```
   {
     "kid": "3g",
     "alg": "RS256"
   }
   ```
2. Retrieve the public key by sending a request to the `/flex/v2/public-keys/{kid}` endpoint:

   * **Test** : GET `apitest.example.com``flex/v2/public-keys/{kid}`
   * **Production** : GET `api.example.com``flex/v2/public-keys/{kid}`
3. Use the returned RSA public key in JSON Web Key format to verify the JWT signature.  
   IMPORTANT Depending on the cryptographic library that tou use, you may need to convert the key to Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format.

Transient Tokens {#ctp-tokens-intro}
====================================

The response to a successful customer interaction with `Unified Checkout` is a transient token. This is returned in the response from the checkout.mount() function. The transient token is a reference to the payment data collected on your behalf. Transient tokens allow secure card payments to occur without risk of exposure to sensitive payment information. The transient token is a short-term token that expires after 15 minutes. This reduces your PCI burden/responsibility and ensures that sensitive information is not exposed to your back-end systems.  
Transient tokens can be included requests sent to the Payment Details API for the customer payment data that is collected.

Transient Token Format {#ctp-tokens-format}
===========================================

The transient token is issued as a JSON Web Token (JWT) ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519 "")). The payload portion of the token is a Base64URL-encoded JSON string and contains various claims. For more information, see [JSON Web Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/Appendix/ctp-appendix-jwts.md "").

{#uc-trans-tkn-ex_codeblock_fgt_cfz_hjc}

Token Verification {#ctp-tokens-verification}
=============================================

When you receive the transient token, you should cryptographically verify its integrity using the public key embedded within the capture context. Doing so verifies that `Payment Gateway` issued the token and that the data has not been tampered with in transit. Verifying the transient token JWT involves verifying the signature and various claims within the token. Programming languages each have their own specific libraries to assist. For an example in Java, see: [Java Example in Github](https://github.com/example/payment-gateway-unified-checkout-sample-java/blob/main/src/main/java/com/payment-gateway/example/service/JwtProcessorService.java "").

PAN BIN in metadata Object
--------------------------

The `cardDetails` object, including the PAN BIN, is included in the transient token `metadata` when a `Click to Pay` network token is used as a payment method. This allows you to display information about the card on invoices and see the BIN details that are linked to the underlying card.

```
"metadata": {
  "cardDetails": {
    "suffix": "9876",
    "prefix": "123456",
    "expirationMonth": "MM",
    "expirationYear": "YYYY"
  }
}
```

The `cardholderAuthenticationStatus` object is included in the `metadata` and enables you to determine if the payload is fully authenticated. When `cardholderAuthenticationStatus` is set to `true`, the payload is fully authenticated. When `cardholderAuthenticationStatus` is set to `false`, the transaction is not authenticated.

```
"metadata": {
  "cardholderAuthenticationStatus": "true"
  }
}
```

Dual-Branded Cards {#dual-co-brand-card-support}
================================================

`Unified Checkout` accepts dual-branded cards. To use this feature, you must include the card networks that have overlapping BIN ranges in the capture context request. For example:

```
"allowedCardNetworks": ["CARD", "MASTERCARD", "AMEX", "CARTESBANCAIRES"]
```

When a card number within an overlapping BIN range is entered, the network that is listed first in the value array for the allowedCardNetworks field is used. Based on the previous example, if the card number 403550XXXXXXXXXX is entered, the payment network for payment processing is Relay.  
During the transaction, the card type is populated with the first network in the list, and the detectedCardTypes field returned in the transient token includes all of the detected card types in the transient token.  
The detectedCardTypes field is returned in the transient token response only when more than one card type is detected.  
If you include Cartes Bancaires as a supported dual-branded card type, `Unified Checkout` displays a radio button with Relay and Mastercard options at checkout. This enables the customer to select which payment scheme they want to use to process the payment. The radio button defaults to the card type that you specify in the capture context request, but the payment is processed using the option that the customer selects during checkout.

The radio button defaults to the card type that you specify in the capture context request, but the payment is processed using the option that the customer selects during checkout.

Payment Details API {#uc-token-get-pymnt-details}
=================================================

This section contains the information you need to retrieve the non-sensitive data associated with a `Unified Checkout` transient token and the payment details API. This API can be used to retrieve personally identifiable information, such as the cardholder name and billing and shipping details, without retrieving payment credentials, which helps ease the PCI compliance burden.
There are two methods of authentication, and they are described in the Getting Started with REST Developer Guide:

* [Set Up a JSON Web Token Message](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-jwt-message-intro.md "")
* [Set Up HTTP Signature Message](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-http-message-intro.md "")
  {#uc-token-get-pymnt-details_ul_ogl_bgz_hjc}

> IMPORTANT  
> ` Payment Gateway ` recommends that you dynamically parse the response for the fields that you are looking for when you integrate with ` Payment Gateway ` APIs. ` Payment Gateway ` may add additional fields in the future.  
> You must ensure that your integration can handle new fields that are returned in the response. Even though the underlying data structures do not change, you must also ensure that your integration can handle changes to the order in which the data is returned. ` Payment Gateway ` uses semantic versioning practices, which enables you to retain backwards compatibility as new fields are introduced in minor version updates.

Endpoint {#uc-token-get-pymnt-details_d14e1140}
-----------------------------------------------

**Production:** `GET ``https://api.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-details/`*{jti}*{#uc-token-get-pymnt-details_d14e1147}  
**Test:** `GET ``https://apitest.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-details/`*{jti}*{#uc-token-get-pymnt-details_d14e1159}  
**Production in Saudi Arabia:** `GET ``https://api.sa.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-details/`*{jti}*  
**Test in Saudi Arabia:** `GET ``https://apitest.sa.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-details/`*{jti}*  
The `{jti}` is the ID of the JWT within the transient token that is returned by `Unified Checkout`. The transient token is a JWT object that you retrieved as part of a successful capture of payment information from a cardholder.

Required Field for Retrieving Transient Token Payment Details {#ctp-token-get-pymnt-details-required}
=====================================================================================================

Your payment details request must include this field:

Payment Credentials API {#ctp-token-get-pymnt-credentials}
==========================================================

This section contains the information you need to retrieve the full payment credentials collected by `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` using the payment credentials API. The payment information is returned in a redundantly signed and encrypted payment object. It uses the JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) as the data standard for communicating this sensitive data.

> IMPORTANT
> Payment information returned by the ` payment-credentials ` endpoint will contain Personal Identifiable Information (PII). Retrieving this sensitive information requires your system to comply with PCI security standards. For more information on PCI security standards, see: <https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/>  
> The response is returned using a JWE data object that is encrypted with your public key created during the `Unified Checkout` tool's integration. For more information, see [Upload Your Encryption Key](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-configuration-intro/ctp-upload-encrypt-key-intro.md "").  
> To decrypt the JWE response, use your private key created during the `Unified Checkout` tool's integration. The decrypted content is a JWS data object containing a JSON payload. This payload can be validated with the `Unified Checkout` public signature key.
> IMPORTANT  
> ` Payment Gateway ` recommends that you dynamically parse the response for the fields that you are looking for when you integrate with ` Payment Gateway ` APIs. ` Payment Gateway ` may add additional fields in the future.  
> You must ensure that your integration can handle new fields that are returned in the response. Even though the underlying data structures do not change, you must also ensure that your integration can handle changes to the order in which the data is returned.

Returned Credentials
--------------------

A payment account number (PAN) or network token is returned on your request depending on your payment method and `Click to Pay` account status:

|     `Click to Pay` Account Status      | American Express |  Mastercard   |     Relay      |
|----------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| New card not saved in `Click to Pay`   | PAN              | PAN           | PAN           |
| New card saved in `Click to Pay`       | PAN              | Network Token | Network Token |
| Existing card stored in `Click to Pay` | PAN              | Network Token | Network Token |
[Payment Credentials Returned by Card Type and `Click to Pay` Account Status]

When you retrieve PAN information from the Payment Credentials API, the response includes the PAN, card expiration date, and the card verification value (CVV). When you retrieve network token information, the response includes the network token and network token cryptogram.

> IMPORTANT
> Relay and Mastercard always attempt to provision a network token. A PAN is returned when a network token is not provisioned before checkout or when the cardholder did not request to enroll the card in ` Click to Pay `.
> Network tokens are generated in the wallet of the `Click to Pay` token requestor ID (TRID). When tokenization is successful, Relay and Mastercard can also complete authentication during the `Click to Pay` experience to acquire a fully authenticated response. For information on authentication, see [Click to Pay Customer Authentication](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-configuration-intro/ctp-authentication.md "").

};

up.show(showArgs).then(transientToken =&gt; console.log(transientToken));
```

Type Definitions
----------------

**TransientToken**  
The response to a successful customer interaction with Unified Checkout is a transient token. The transient token is a reference to the payment data collected on your behalf. Tokens allow secure card payments to occur without risk of exposure to sensitive payment information. The transient token is a short-term token that lasts 15 minutes. This reduces your PCI burden and responsibility and ensures that sensitive information is not exposed to your backend systems.  
It is in a JSON Web Token format. The payload of the transient token may contain useful metadata in relation to the stored sensitive info. However , all of this info is safe to use and store on your systems.  
The transient token can be used to complete a payment or other services, after which the transient data will be evicted from the token store.  
**Type:** string  
**Examples**  
How to Split the Transient Token

```
const transientToken = 'hhhhhhhhhh.pppppppppp.sssssssssss';

const segments = transientToken.split('.');
const urlBase64Decode = (s) =&gt; atob(s.replace(/_/g, '/').replace(/-/g, '+'));

const header = JSON.parse(urlBase64Decode(segments[0]));
const payload = JSON.parse(urlBase64Decode(segments[1]));
const signature = segments[2];
```

`Unified Checkout` Configuration {#ctp-configuration-intro}
===========================================================

This section contains information necessary to configure `Unified Checkout` in the `Business Center`:

* [Upload Your Encryption Key](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-configuration-intro/ctp-upload-encrypt-key-intro.md "")
* [Enable Click to Pay](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-uc-getting-started-integration-flow/ctp-enable-digital-pay-intro.md "")
* [Manage Permissions](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-configuration-intro/uc-manage-permissions-intro.md "")

Upload Your Encryption Key {#uc-upload-encrypt-key-intro}
=========================================================

Payment information can be retrieved from the `Unified Checkout` platform by invoking the Payment Credentials API. This API retrieves all of the data captured by `Unified Checkout`. This information is transmitted in an encrypted format to ensure the security of the payment information while in transit.  
You must generate an encryption key pair to retrieve this encrypted payment information, and the public encryption key must uploaded to the `Unified Checkout` system.

Generate a Public Private Key Pair {#uc-generate-keypair}
=========================================================

You must generate a public-private key pair to upload to the `Unified Checkout` system. The public key is uploaded to the `Unified Checkout` platform and is used to encrypt sensitive information in transit. The private key is used to decrypt the sensitive payment information on your server. Only the private key can properly decrypt the payment information.
IMPORTANT You must secure your private decryption key. This key must never be exposed to any external systems or it will risk the integrity of the secure channel.  
`Unified Checkout` accepts only keys that meet these requirements:
* Only RSA keys are supported. Elliptical curves are not supported.
* The minimum accepted RSA key size is 2048 bits.
  * RSA keys must be in JWK format. More information on JWK format is available here:  
    [rfc7517](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517 "").
* The key ID must be a valid UUID.

Uploading Your Key Pair {#uc-upload-key}
========================================

When you have generated your encryption key pairs, you can upload your key to the `Unified Checkout` platform. Keys can be loaded at any hierarchy that is enabled for them and are used for all child entities that do not have keys loaded. You can upload a key at parent and child levels, but child keys override parent keys.  
Follow these steps to upload your key pair:

1. Navigate to Payment Configuration \&gt; Unified Checkout. The `Unified Checkout` configuration page opens.  
   ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/uc-decrypt-pay-details.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)
2. Click Enabled. You can upload your key in the appropriate section.
3. Upload the public encryption key in JWK format, and click Save.  
   ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/uc-upload-pub-key.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Enable `Click to Pay` {#ctp_enable_digital_pay_intro}
=====================================================

To enable `Click to Pay` on `Unified Checkout`, you must first register `Click to Pay`. This process sends the appropriate information to the digital payment systems and registers your page with each system.  
Enable `Click to Pay` for `Unified Checkout` in the `Business Center`. `Click to Pay` is listed as an available digital payment method offered by `Unified Checkout`.

Enabling `Click to Pay` {#uc-enable-digital-pay-ctp}
====================================================

To begin your integration, you must first enable `Click to Pay`. `Click to Pay` is a digital payment solution that allows customers to pay with their preferred card network and issuer without entering their card details on every website. Customers can use Relay, Mastercard, and American Express cards to streamline their purchase experience. `Click to Pay` provides a fast, secure, and consistent checkout experience across devices and browsers.  
Follow these steps to enable in `Click to Pay` on `Unified Checkout`:

1. Log in to the `Business Center`:  
   Test URL: ` `<https://businesscentertest.example.com/ebc2>` `  
   Production URL: ` `<https://businesscenter.example.com>` `  
   If you are unable to access this page, contact your sales representative. {#uc-enable-digital-pay-ctp_step-1}
   {#uc-enable-digital-pay-ctp_step-1}

2. In the `Business Center`, go to the left navigation panel and choose Payment Configuration \&gt; Unified Checkout. The `Unified Checkout` customer experience page appears:

   {#uc-enable-digital-pay-ctp_step-2}

3. In the Payment Options section, click **Manage**. The Payment Options page appears.

4. Click **Manage** next to `Click to Pay`. The `Click to Pay` configuration page appears.

5. Enter your business name and website URL.

6. Click Submit.

7. Contact your implementation contact or technical account manager to request that you be enabled for tokenization within `Click to Pay`. Your implementation contact or technical account manager will confirm that you were configured successfully and that you can now accept digital payments with `Click to Pay`.

   > IMPORTANT
   > ` Click to Pay ` uses network tokenization for transactions. These network tokens are stored in the vault of the token requestor ID (TRID) for the card scheme.

Manage Permissions {#uc-manage-permissions-intro}
=================================================

Portfolio administrators can set permissions for new or existing `Business Center` user roles for `Unified Checkout`. Administrators retain full read and write permissions. They enable you to regulate access to specific pages and specify who can access, view, or amend digital products within `Unified Checkout`.  
Portfolio administrators must apply the appropriate user role permission for any existing or newly created `Business Center` user roles for `Unified Checkout`. For information on managing permissions as a portfolio administrator, see [Managing Permissions as a Portfolio Administrator](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-configuration-intro/uc-manage-permissions-intro/uc-manage-permissions-port.md "").  
If you are a transacting merchant, you might find that your permissions are restricted. If your permissions are restricted, a message appears indicating that you do not have access, or buttons might appear gray. To make changes to your digital products within `Unified Checkout` that have restricted permissions, contact your portfolio administrator's customer support representative. For more information, see [Managing Permissions as a Direct Merchant](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-configuration-intro/uc-manage-permissions-intro/uc-manage-permissions-merch.md "").

Managing Permissions as a Direct Merchant {#uc-manage-permissions-merch}
========================================================================

Follow these steps to configure and manage user permissions in the `Business Center` for `Unified Checkout` as a direct merchant:

1. On the left navigation panel, navigate to Account Management.

2. Click Roles to display a list of your user roles.

3. Click the pencil icon next to the user role that you want to update.

4. Click Payment Configuration Permission.

Click to Pay Customer Authentication {#ctp-authentication}
==========================================================

When you enable customer authentication through Click to Pay, you give `Payment Gateway` permission to request that Relay and Mastercard provide an authenticated payload for each transaction. Authentication takes place within the authentication service of each card type. You must inspect the payload that is returned to you to determine if the transaction is authenticated.  
For information about enabling customer authentication through Click to Pay, see these topics:

* [Enable Click to Pay Customer Authentication Using the API](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-configuration-intro/ctp-authentication/boarding-click-to-pay-auth-enable-intro.md "")
* [Enable Click to Pay Customer Authentication Using the Business Center](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-configuration-intro/ctp-authentication/ctp-authentication-config-ebc.md "")
  {#ctp-authentication_ul_iyg_v1b_3jc}  
  When the customer completes a transaction using a Relay or Mastercard Click to Pay credentials, authentication is managed within Click to Pay. When the customer checks out using manual card entry and does not save their card to Click to Pay, the transaction is not processed through Click to Pay and you must complete authentication based on your existing authentication method.

> IMPORTANT
> American Express cards cannot be authenticated through Click to Pay customer authentication. You must use another authentication method for this card type.

Authentication Flow {#ctp-authentication_section_rkj_xcs_hjc}

Upload Your Encryption Key {#uc-upload-encrypt-key-intro}
=========================================================

Payment information can be retrieved from the `Unified Checkout` platform by invoking the Payment Credentials API. This API retrieves all of the data captured by `Unified Checkout`. This information is transmitted in an encrypted format to ensure the security of the payment information while in transit.  
You can retrieve payment information from the `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` platform from the checkout response payloads. This information is transmitted in an encrypted format to ensure that sensitive data is secure. To retrieve and decrypt this information, you must set up message-level encryption. For information about enabling MLE, see *How to Set up REST* in the [Getting Started with REST Developer Guide](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-setup-workflow.md "") and follow the steps based on your integration method.  
You must generate an encryption key pair to retrieve this encrypted payment information, and the public encryption key must uploaded to the `Unified Checkout` system.

Generate a Public Private Key Pair {#uc-generate-keypair}
=========================================================

You must generate a public-private key pair to upload to the `Unified Checkout` system. The public key is uploaded to the `Unified Checkout` platform and is used to encrypt sensitive information in transit. The private key is used to decrypt the sensitive payment information on your server. Only the private key can properly decrypt the payment information.
IMPORTANT You must secure your private decryption key. This key must never be exposed to any external systems or it will risk the integrity of the secure channel.  
`Unified Checkout` accepts only keys that meet these requirements:
* Only RSA keys are supported. Elliptical curves are not supported.
* The minimum accepted RSA key size is 2048 bits.
  * RSA keys must be in JWK format. More information on JWK format is available here:  
    [rfc7517](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517 "").
* The key ID must be a valid UUID.
  {#uc-generate-keypair_ul_hgf_qht_hjc}

Uploading Your Key Pair {#uc-upload-key}
========================================

When you have generated your encryption key pairs, you can upload your key to the `Unified Checkout` platform. Keys can be loaded at any hierarchy that is enabled for them and are used for all child entities that do not have keys loaded. You can upload a key at parent and child levels, but child keys override parent keys.  
Follow these steps to upload your key pair:

1. Log in to the `Business Center`:  
   Test URL: ` `<https://businesscentertest.example.com/ebc2>` `{#uc-upload-key_ebc-test-pgw}  
   Production URL: ` `<https://businesscenter.example.com>` `{#uc-upload-key_ebc-prod-pgw}  
   If you are unable to access this page, contact your sales representative. {#uc-upload-key_step-1}
   {#uc-upload-key_step-1}
2. In the `Business Center`, go to the left navigation panel and choose Payment Configuration \&gt; Key Management. The Key Management page appears.{#uc-upload-key_step-2}
   {#uc-upload-key_step-2}
3. Click +Generate key. The Create Key page appears.
4. On the Create Key page, select Token Management MLE.
5. Click Generate key.
6. Enter your MLE public key value in JWK format.
7. Click Create key.
8. On the Key Management page, search for your key and select it.

[`UnifiedCheckoutError` Properties]

Detect Errors {#uc_handle_errors_detect}
========================================

Errors may be serialized through `postMessage`. `Payment Gateway` recommends that you use the `name` property instead of `instanceof`:

```
try {
  const result = await checkout.mount('#buttons');
} catch (error) {
  if (error.name === 'UnifiedCheckoutError') {
    // Access error.reason, error.message, error.details
  }
}
```

You can also write a helper function that can be reused:

```
function isUnifiedCheckoutError(obj) {
  return (
    obj !== null &&
    typeof obj === 'object' &&
    obj.name === 'UnifiedCheckoutError' &&
    typeof obj.reason === 'string' &&
    typeof obj.message === 'string'
  );
}
```

Error Handling Patterns {#uc_handle_errors_pattern}
===================================================

Try/Catch
---------

```
try {
  const client = await VAS.UnifiedCheckout(sessionJWT);
  const checkout = await client.createCheckout();
  const result = await checkout.mount('#buttons');
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.reason, error.message);
}
```

Promise .catch()
----------------

```
VAS.UnifiedCheckout(sessionJWT)
  .then(client =&gt; client.createCheckout())
  .then(checkout =&gt; checkout.mount('#buttons'))
  .catch(error =&gt; console.error(error.reason, error.message));
```

Centralized Error Logging via Events
------------------------------------

Errors from all integrations are applicable up to the client level. Use `client.on('error')` for centralized logging:

```
const client = await VAS.UnifiedCheckout(sessionJWT);

client.on('error', (err) =&gt; {
  errorReporter.send({
    source: err.source,   // "checkout", "trigger", "button", or "client"
    code: err.code,
    message: err.message
  });
});
```

`Payment Gateway` recommends that you do this as it catches errors from all checkouts, triggers, and buttons created from this client instance.

Error Codes {#ctp-handle-errors-codes}
======================================

Initialization Errors {#ctp-handle-errors-codes_section_kw4_czg_3jc}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

These errors are returned during `VAS.UnifiedCheckout(sessionJWT)`:

JSON Web Tokens {#uc-appendix-jwts}
===================================

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are digitally signed JSON objects based on the open standard [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519 ""). These tokens provide a compact, self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties. These tokens are signed with an RSA-encoded public/private key pair. The signature is calculated using the header and body, which enables the receiver to validate that the content has not been tampered with.  
A JWT takes the form of a string, and consists of three parts separated by dots:

```
&lt;Header&gt;.&lt;Payload&gt;.&lt;Signature&gt;
```

The header and payload is **Base64-encoded JSON** and contains these claims:

* **Header** : The algorithm and token type. For example:

  ```
  {
    "kid": "zu",
    "alg": "RS256"
  }
  ```
* **Payload** : The claims of what the token represents. For example:

  ```
  {
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "iat": 1516239022
  }
  ```
* **Signature**: The signature is computed from the header and payload using a secret or private key.

{#uc-appendix-jwts_ul_ozy_ysn_4pb}

> IMPORTANT
> When working with JWTs, ` Payment Gateway ` recommends that you use a well- maintained JWT library to ensure proper decoding and parsing of the JWT.  
> IMPORTANT When parsing the JWT's JSON payload, you must ensure that you implement a robust solution for transversing JSON. Additional elements can be added to the JSON in future releases. Follow JSON parsing best practices to ensure that you can handle the addition of new data elements in the future.

Reason Codes {#uc-appendix-reason-codes}

| `400` - Capture Context API | `CAPTURE_CONTEXT_INVALID`              | The `Unified Checkout` configuration rejected the request due to invalid values. This reason is returned when the minimum required fields are missing or invalid or the capture context contradicts which products are enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `400` - Capture Context API | `CHECKOUT_ERROR`                       | Checkout failed. This reason is returned when a general, non‑payment‑method‑specific error occurs during the UnifiedPayments checkout flow. When the checkout failure is specifically related to tokenization, `Click to Pay` SDK, SRC launch, Google Pay, etc., the SDK returns a more specific error                                                                                                                            |
| `400` - Capture Context API | `CLICK_TO_PAY_SDK_LOAD_ERROR`          | This reason is returned when the UI cannot be successfully rendered. For example: * Network failures (CDN unavailable, blocked, or timed out) * Browser or device restrictions are preventing the SDK from loading. * Incorrect or missing configuration causes `Unified Checkout` not to request the SDK asset. * The merchant site CSP is blocking the SDK. * Any runtime error that prevents `Click to Pay` JS initialization. |
| `400` - Capture Context API | `CREATE_TOKEN_TIMEOUT`                 | The token creation timed out. This reason is returned when the `Unified Checkout` JavaScript SDK cannot generate the transient token within the expected time-frame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `400` - Capture Context API | `CREATE_TOKEN_XHR_ERROR`               | This reason is returned when the system attempts to create a token, but a network / XHR-level failure occurs before the token can be created. This is a client-side SDK network failure, not a timeout or back-end validation error.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `400` - Capture Context API | `ENCRYPT_CARD_FOR_SRC_ENROLMENT_ERROR` | Encrypt card for SRC enrollment failed. This reason is returned when `Unified Checkout` attempts to encrypt a card to enroll it in the SRC / `Click to Pay` system and the encryption step fails. This causes the SRC enrolment to abort.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `400` - Capture Context API | `GOOGLEPAY_CHECKOUT_ERROR`             | Checkout failed. This reason is returned when `Unified Checkout` attempts to complete a Google Pay checkout, but the Google Pay--based transaction fails internally in the `Unified Checkout` checkout flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `400` - Complete API        | `COMPLETE_AUTHENTICATION_CANCELED`     | Occurs when the user cancels the authentication process during Cardinal step‑up. This value is returned when the customer cancels or prematurely exits the 3‑D Secure (Cardinal) step‑up authentication flow during `unifiedPayments.complete()`.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `400` - Complete API        | `COMPLETE_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`       | Occurs when the complete authentication process fails during Cardinal Step‑Up. Returned when the 3‑D Secure (Cardinal) authentication attempt fails---typically due to incorrect OTP, issuer decline, timeout interpreted as failure, or ACS technical error---during `unifiedPayments.complete()`.                                                                                                                               |
| `400` - Complete API        | `COMPLETE_ERROR`                       | Occurs when an error occurs whilst attempting to complete the transaction. Returned when an unexpected or uncategorized error occurs during `unifiedPayments.complete()`---typically caused by internal processing exceptions or failures that cannot be classified as authentication failure, user cancellation, validation error, or processor decline.                                                                         |
| `400` - Complete API        | `COMPLETE_IN_PROGRESS`                 | Returned when `unifiedPayments.complete()` is invoked again while a previous Complete operation is still running. This is caused by duplicate submissions, race conditions, or UI re-renders that trigger multiple Complete calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `400` - Complete API        | `COMPLETE_NOT_ALLOWED`                 | Occurs if complete is not allowed for this transaction. Returned when the merchant calls `unifiedPayments.complete()` in a state where the transaction is not permitted to be completed---typically due to missing/invalid Complete Mandate, calling complete() before the customer has completed the UC UI flow, using an unsupported payment type, or invoking complete() at the wrong time in the lifecycle.                   |
| `400` - Complete API        | `COMPLETE_TRANSACTION_CANCELLED`       | Occurs when the user cancels the transaction. Returned when the user (or the payment provider on behalf of the user) cancels the transaction during the Complete phase --- including cancellations on the UC UI, cancellations during redirect/step‑up, or cancellation states returned by APMs such as PPRO or Tink.                                                                                                             |
| `400` - Complete API        | `COMPLETE_TRANSACTION_FAILED`          | Consumer transaction has failed. Returned when the payment attempt reaches the processor or APM provider and is returned as a *failure* --- such as card declines, failed 3DS outcomes, APM failures, or downstream processor rejections.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `400` - Complete API        | `COMPLETE_VALIDATION_ERROR`            | Occurs when there is a validation issue relating to the parameters you have supplied in your complete call. Returned when the merchant sends invalid, missing, malformed, or inconsistent parameters to the `unifiedPayments.complete()` call --- typically a bad trust token or a mismatched/incorrect payload.                                                                                                                  |

JSON Web Tokens {#ctp-appendix-jwts}
====================================

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are digitally signed JSON objects based on the open standard [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519 ""). These tokens provide a compact, self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties. These tokens are signed with an RSA-encoded public/private key pair. The signature is calculated using the header and body, which enables the receiver to validate that the content has not been tampered with.  
A JWT takes the form of a string, and consists of three parts separated by dots:

```
&lt;Header&gt;.&lt;Payload&gt;.&lt;Signature&gt;
```

{#ctp-appendix-jwts_codeblock_czg_s5z_hjc}  
The header and payload is **Base64-encoded JSON** and contains these claims:

* **Header** : The algorithm and token type. For example:

  ```
  {
    "kid": "zu",
    "alg": "RS256"
  }
  ```

  {#ctp-appendix-jwts_codeblock_dzg_s5z_hjc}

* **Payload** : The claims of what the token represents. For example:

  ```
  {
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "iat": 1516239022
  }
  ```

  {#ctp-appendix-jwts_codeblock_ezg_s5z_hjc}

* **Signature**: The signature is computed from the header and payload using a secret or private key.

{#ctp-appendix-jwts_ul_ozy_ysn_4pb}

> IMPORTANT
> When working with JWTs, ` Payment Gateway ` recommends that you use a well- maintained JWT library to ensure proper decoding and parsing of the JWT.  
> IMPORTANT When parsing the JWT's JSON payload, you must ensure that you implement a robust solution for transversing JSON. Additional elements can be added to the JSON in future releases. Follow JSON parsing best practices to ensure that you can handle the addition of new data elements in the future.

Reason Codes {#ctp-appendix-reason-codes}
=========================================

A `Unified Checkout` request response returns one of the following reason codes:

| Reason Code                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ||

| `400` - Capture Context API | `CAPTURE_CONTEXT_EXPIRED`              | This reason is returned when the capture context JWT has passed its expiration time of 900 seconds (15 minutes). Example decrypted JWT fields include `"exp": "1762894371"` and `"iat": "1762893471"`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `400` - Capture Context API | `CAPTURE_CONTEXT_INVALID`              | The `Unified Checkout` configuration rejected the request due to invalid values. This reason is returned when the minimum required fields are missing or invalid or the capture context contradicts which products are enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `400` - Capture Context API | `CHECKOUT_ERROR`                       | Checkout failed. This reason is returned when a general, non‑payment‑method‑specific error occurs during the UnifiedCheckout checkout flow. When the checkout failure is specifically related to tokenization, `Click to Pay` SDK, SRC launch, Google Pay, etc., the SDK returns a more specific error                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `400` - Capture Context API | `CLICK_TO_PAY_SDK_LOAD_ERROR`          | This reason is returned when the UI cannot be successfully rendered. For example: * Network failures (CDN unavailable, blocked, or timed out) * Browser or device restrictions are preventing the SDK from loading. * Incorrect or missing configuration causes `Unified Checkout` not to request the SDK asset. * The merchant site CSP is blocking the SDK. * Any runtime error that prevents `Click to Pay` JS initialization. {#ctp-appendix-reason-codes_ul_bl5_n5z_hjc} |
| `400` - Capture Context API | `CREATE_TOKEN_TIMEOUT`                 | The token creation timed out. This reason is returned when the `Unified Checkout` JavaScript SDK cannot generate the transient token within the expected time-frame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `400` - Capture Context API | `CREATE_TOKEN_XHR_ERROR`               | This reason is returned when the system attempts to create a token, but a network / XHR-level failure occurs before the token can be created. This is a client-side SDK network failure, not a timeout or back-end validation error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

[Reason Codes]

Loading the JavaScript Library {#uc-getting-started-cs-js-library-intro}
========================================================================

Use the client library asset path and client library integrity value that is returned by the capture context response to invoke `Unified Checkout` on your page.  
You must retrieve these values from the clientLibrary and clientLibraryIntegrity fields that are returned in the JWT from `https://apitest.example.com``/uc/v1/sessions`. You can use these values to create your script tags.  
You must perform this process for each transaction, as these values are unique for each transaction. You must avoid hard-coding values for the clientLibrary and clientLibraryIntegrity fields to prevent client-side errors.  
For example, a response from `https://apitest.example.com``/uc/v1/sessions` would include:

```
"data": {
    "clientLibrary":"[EXTRACT clientLibrary VALUE from here]",
    "clientLibraryIntegrity": "[EXTRACT clientLibraryIntegrity VALUE from here]"
}
```

Below is an example script tag:

```
&lt;script src="[INSERT clientLibrary VALUE HERE]" 
    integrity=”[INSERT clientLibraryIntegrity VALUE HERE]”
    crossorigin=”anonymous”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

> IMPORTANT
> Use the clientLibrary and clientLibraryIntegrity parameter values in the capture context response to obtain the ` Unified Checkout ` JavaScript library URL and the integrity value. This ensures that you are always using the most up-to-date library and protects against fraud. Do not hard-code the ` Unified Checkout ` JavaScript library URL or integrity value.  
> When you load the library, the capture context from your initial server-side request is used to invoke the accept function.  
> For information about the client-side API, see [JavaScript API Reference](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-appendix-js-reference-v1.md "").

Payment Details API {#uc-token-get-pymnt-details}
=================================================

This section contains the information you need to retrieve the non-sensitive data associated with a `Unified Checkout` transient token and the payment details API. This API can be used to retrieve personally identifiable information, such as the cardholder name and billing and shipping details, without retrieving payment credentials, which helps ease the PCI compliance burden.
There are two methods of authentication, and they are described in the Getting Started with REST Developer Guide:

* [Set Up a JSON Web Token Message](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-jwt-message-intro.md "")
* [Set Up HTTP Signature Message](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-http-message-intro.md "")

> IMPORTANT  
> ` Payment Gateway ` recommends that you dynamically parse the response for the fields that you are looking for when you integrate with ` Payment Gateway ` APIs. ` Payment Gateway ` may add additional fields in the future.  
> You must ensure that your integration can handle new fields that are returned in the response. Even though the underlying data structures do not change, you must also ensure that your integration can handle changes to the order in which the data is returned. ` Payment Gateway ` uses semantic versioning practices, which enables you to retain backwards compatibility as new fields are introduced in minor version updates.

Endpoint {#uc-token-get-pymnt-details_d14e1140}
-----------------------------------------------

**Production:** `GET ``https://api.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-details/`*{jti}*{#uc-token-get-pymnt-details_d14e1147}  
**Test:** `GET ``https://apitest.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-details/`*{jti}*{#uc-token-get-pymnt-details_d14e1159}  
**Production in Saudi Arabia:** `GET ``https://api.sa.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-details/`*{jti}*  
**Test in Saudi Arabia:** `GET ``https://apitest.sa.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-details/`*{jti}*  
The `{jti}` is the ID of the JWT within the transient token that is returned by `Unified Checkout`. The transient token is a JWT object that you retrieved as part of a successful capture of payment information from a cardholder.

Click to Pay Customer Authentication {#uc-authentication}
=========================================================

When you enable customer authentication through Click to Pay, you give `Payment Gateway` permission to send Relay the required authentication information for each transaction. When the customer completes a transaction using a Relay card that is already stored in Click to Pay, authentication is managed within Click to Pay.  
Click to Pay authentication is only available for Relay branded cards that are tokenized with Click to Pay. If Click to Pay does not authenticate the transaction, but you are using the complete mandate with the consumerAuthentication field set to `true`, authentication is attempted as part of this request. When you do not use the complete mandate, you must check the result of the cardholderAuthenticationStatus field in the transient token and request `Payer Authentication` directly when it is required.

> IMPORTANT
> American Express and Mastercard card brands cannot be authenticated through Click to Pay customer authentication.

Authentication Flow

JavaScript Example: Client-Defined Trigger for `Click to Pay` or PAN Entry {#uc-getting-started-cs-js-trigger-ctp-pan-example}
==============================================================================================================================

When you display `CLICKTOPAY` or `PANENTRY` as allowed payment types, you can load the UI without displaying the `Unified Checkout` checkout button. You can do this by creating a trigger that defines what event loads the UI.  
You can create a trigger only for `CLICKTOPAY` or `PANENTRY` payment methods:

```
//PAN Entry

Capture Context {#uc-capture-context-intro}
===========================================

This section contains the information you need to set up your server. Initializing `Unified Checkout` within your webpage begins with a server-to-server call to the sessions API. This step authenticates your merchant credentials, and establishes how the frontend components will function. The sessions API request contains parameters that define how `Unified Checkout` performs.  
The server-side component provides this information:

* A transaction-specific public key is used by the customer's browser to protect the transaction.
* An authenticated context description package that manages the payment experience on the client side. It includes available payment options such as card networks, payment interface styling, and payment methods.

The functions are compiled in a JSON Web Token (JWT) object referred to as the *capture context*.  
For information on JWTs see [JSON Web Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/Appendix/uc-appendix-jwts.md ""). The capture context request is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) that includes all of the merchant-specific parameters. This request tells the frontend JavaScript library how to behave within your payment experience. The request provides authentication, one-time keys, the target origin to the `Unified Checkout` integration in addition to allowed card networks and payment types. The capture context request includes these elements:
* allowedCardNetworks
* allowedPaymentTypes
* clientVersion
* targetOrigin
* completeMandate

Browser Support
---------------

`Unified Checkout` supports these browser versions:

* Safari 16
* Firefox 121
* Google Chrome/Chium-based browsers 118
* Microsoft Edge 118

Capture Context Example {#uc-capture-context-intro_uc-capture-context-codeblock}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the targetOrigins and the allowedPaymentTypes fields to define the target origin and the accepted digital payment methods in your capture context. Use the completeMandate to orchestrate follow-on services such as Payments, `Decision Manager`, `Payer Authentication`, and `TMS`. For example:

```

Payment Credentials API {#uc-token-get-pymnt-credentials}
=========================================================

This section contains the information you need to retrieve the full payment credentials collected by the `Unified Checkout` tool using the payment credentials API. The payment information is returned in a redundantly signed and encrypted payment object. It uses the JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) as the data standard for communicating this sensitive data.

> IMPORTANT
> Payment information returned by the ` payment-credentials ` endpoint will contain Personal Identifiable Information (PII). Retrieving this sensitive information requires your system to comply with PCI security standards. For more information on PCI security standards, see: <https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/>  
> The response is returned using a JWE data object that is encrypted with your public key created during the `Unified Checkout` tool's integration. For more information, see [Upload Your Encryption Key](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-configuration-intro/uc-upload-encrypt-key-intro.md "").  
> To decrypt the JWE response, use your private key created during the `Unified Checkout` tool's integration. The decrypted content is a JWS data object containing a JSON payload. This payload can be validated with the `Unified Checkout` public signature key.  
> IMPORTANT  
> ` Payment Gateway ` recommends that you dynamically parse the response for the fields that you are looking for when you integrate with ` Payment Gateway ` APIs. ` Payment Gateway ` may add additional fields in the future.  
> You must ensure that your integration can handle new fields that are returned in the response. Even though the underlying data structures do not change, you must also ensure that your integration can handle changes to the order in which the data is returned. ` Payment Gateway ` uses semantic versioning practices, which enables you to retain backwards compatibility as new fields are introduced in minor version updates.

Returned Credentials
--------------------

A payment account number (PAN) or network token is returned on your request depending on your payment method and `Click to Pay` account status:

|     `Click to Pay` Account Status      | American Express |  Mastercard   |     Relay      |
|----------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| New card not saved in `Click to Pay`   | PAN              | PAN           | PAN           |
| New card saved in `Click to Pay`       | PAN              | Network Token | Network Token |
| Existing card stored in `Click to Pay` | PAN              | Network Token | Network Token |
[Payment Credentials Returned by Card Type and `Click to Pay` Account Status]

When you retrieve PAN information from the Payment Credentials API, the response includes the PAN, card expiration date, and the card verification value (CVV). When you retrieve network token information, the response includes the network token and network token cryptogram.

> IMPORTANT Relay and Mastercard always attempt to provision a network token. When a network token is not provisioned, the default payment method is the PAN. When there is a PAN transaction, the PAN is not stored in the consumers wallet and it is treated as a single transaction.
> Network tokens are generated in the wallet of the `Click to Pay` token requestor ID (TRID). When tokenization is successful, Relay attempts to complete authentication during the `Click to Pay` experience. For information on authentication, see [Click to Pay Customer Authentication](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-authentication.md "").  
> You must meet these requirements for tokenization to be successfully configured for your merchant ID (MID):

* `Click to Pay` is enabled as a digital payment in the `Business Center`.
* The transacting MID is configured for tokenization with `Click to Pay`. Contact your Implementation Consultant or Technical Account Manager to configure tokenization with `Click to Pay`.
* The allowedPaymentTypes field value is set to `CLICKTOPAY` in the capture context. For information on the capture context, see [Capture Context API](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-setup-capture-context.md "").

Endpoint {#uc-token-get-pymnt-credentials_d14e634}
--------------------------------------------------

**Production:** `GET ``https://api.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-credentials/`*{ReferenceID}*{#uc-token-get-pymnt-credentials_d14e641}  
**Test:** `GET ``https://apitest.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-credentials/`*{ReferenceID}*{#uc-token-get-pymnt-credentials_d14e653}  
**Production in Saudi Arabia:** `GET ``https://api.sa.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-credentials/`*{ReferenceID}*  
**Test in Saudi Arabia:** `GET ``https://apitest.sa.example.com``/flex/v2/payment-credentials/`*{ReferenceID}*  
The *{ReferenceID}* is the reference ID returned in the `id` field when you created the payment credentials.

Enrolling in Apple Pay {#uc-enable-digital-pay-applepay}
========================================================

Apple Pay is a digital payment service that enables users to make secure and convenient transactions using their Apple devices. Users can add their credit or debit cards to the Wallet app and use them to pay online or in apps in a safe and convenient consumer experience.  
To enable Apple Pay you must first host a public certificate on your web page and then pass your merchant name and domain name to Apple. Apple crawls out to your web page to validate the presence of this certificate to ensure the web pages are properly vetted and registered with Apple.  
Follow these steps to validate your domain and enroll in Apple Pay:

1. Navigate to Payment Configuration \&gt; `Unified Checkout`.
2. In the Apple Pay section, click **Set Up**.
3. Follow the link to download the certificate.
4. Upload the *apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association* certificate file to your web server at:  
   `/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`  
   You must verify that the file is accessible through HTTPS. You can validate this by visiting `https://&lt;your-domain&gt;/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`.
5. Click Verify Domain.
6. Enter the domain name where you are hosting Apple Pay. This must be the same domain to which you uploaded the public certificate.  
   Your domain is now verified for Apple Pay.

#### AFTER COMPLETING THE TASK

> IMPORTANT
> In order to run an end-to-end test of the Apple Pay service on ` Unified Checkout `, you must perform additional setup steps. See [Preparing a Device for Testing Apple Pay on Unified Checkout](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-enable-digital-pay-applepay-prep-test-device.md "").

`Click to Pay` UI Guidelines {#ctp-ui-screens}
==============================================

The UI that is built in `Unified Checkout` for `Click to Pay` is built based on the EMV `Click to Pay` XC Guidelines V1.1. `Unified Checkout` has simplified the integration of the UI. The only UI work that you must complete is the placement of the payment option.

> IMPORTANT
> You must include ` Click to Pay ` as one of the presented payment methods and not as a separate payment method.  
> `Unified Checkout` captures all card details that are manually entered by the cardholder. This enables the cardholder to enroll in `Click to Pay` and removes the requirement for the cardholder to manually enter their card details the next time they check out.  
> `Unified Checkout` provides a standard payment label in the `Unified Checkout` JavaScript that is loaded in your checkout page. One of these scenarios occurs when the cardholder selects the button:

* The cardholder is recognized.
* The cardholder is not recognized but has a `Click to Pay` account.
* The cardholder does not have a `Click to Pay` account.
  {#ctp-ui-screens_ul_gh5_35s_hjc}  
  You can also trigger the `Unified Checkout` flow using a custom button. If you are using your own custom button, your payment button or widget must display the `Click to Pay` image for the cardholder. For information about a custom button, see [JavaScript Example: Client-Defined Trigger for Click to Pay or PAN Entry](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-getting-started-cs-setup-intro/ctp-getting-started-cs-js-library-intro/ctp-getting-started-cs-js-trigger-ctp-pan-example.md "").

> IMPORTANT
> Your implementation consultant will ask you for a mock-up of your payment flow for confirmation that it is compliant with the ` Click to Pay ` UI design standards.

Recognized `Click to Pay` Customer {#ctp-ui-screens_section_ih5_35s_hjc}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cardholder is presented with their stored `Click to Pay` cards in the UI when they are on a recognized device:

#### Figure: {#ctp-ui-screens_fig-ctp-recog-device}

Recognized `Click to Pay` Customer UI ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/ctp-recog-device-445x200.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Unrecognized `Click to Pay` Customer {#ctp-ui-screens_section_kh5_35s_hjc}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the cardholder has a `Click to Pay` account but is not on a registered device, they receive a one-time password to their registered email address and phone number to authenticate their identity before their stored `Click to Pay` credentials are shown:

#### Figure: {#ctp-ui-screens_fig-ctp-recog-account}

No `Click to Pay` Account {#ctp-ui-screens_section_mh5_35s_hjc}
---------------------------------------------------------------

When the cardholder does not have a `Click to Pay` account, they can provide a new email address to perform a new lookup or they can choose to enter their card details manually. The cardholder can make a one-time payment or complete the payment and choose to create a `Click to Pay` account for future use:

#### Figure: {#ctp-ui-screens_fig-ctp-no-account}

Card Payment Options with `Click to Pay` in UI
----------------------------------------------

Do not present the `Unified Checkout` payment button as a separate payment method from the card payment button. If you do this, the cardholder is not prompted with their `Click to Pay` cards and must manually enter their payment details. They will also not have the option to store their card within `Click to Pay` for future use.  
These examples show multiple card payment options and `Click to Pay` in a UI:

Card Payment Options with `Click to Pay` in UI {#ctp-appendix-ui-ux-ex_section_pxs_2tz_hjc}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not present the `Unified Checkout` payment button as a separate payment method from the card payment button. If you do this, the cardholder is not prompted with their `Click to Pay` cards and must manually enter their payment details. They will also not have the option to store their card within `Click to Pay` for future use.  
These examples show multiple card payment options and `Click to Pay` in a UI:

JavaScript Example: Initializing the SDK {#uc-getting-started-cs-js-library-example}
====================================================================================

```
const client = await VAS.UnifiedCheckout(sessionJWT);
```

In this example, `sessionJWT` refers to the capture context JWT.

Dual-Branded Cards {#dual-co-brand-card-support}
================================================

`Unified Checkout` accepts dual-branded cards. To use this feature, you must include the card networks that have overlapping BIN ranges in the capture context request. For example:

```
"allowedCardNetworks": ["CARD", "MASTERCARD", "AMEX", "CARTESBANCAIRES"]
```

When a card number within an overlapping BIN range is entered, the network that is listed first in the value array for the allowedCardNetworks field is used. Based on the previous example, if the card number 403550XXXXXXXXXX is entered, the payment network for payment processing is Relay.  
During the transaction, the card type is populated with the first network in the list, and the **detectedCardTypes** field returned in the transient token includes all of the detected card types in the transient token.  
The detectedCardTypes field is returned in the transient token response only when more than one card type is detected.  
If you include Cartes Bancaires as a supported dual-branded card type, `Unified Checkout` displays a radio button with Relay and Mastercard options at checkout. This enables the customer to select which payment scheme they want to use to process the payment. The radio button defaults to the card type that you specify in the capture context request, but the payment is processed using the option selected by the customer during checkout.

Set Up Customer Authentication for Relay Click to Pay {#uc-authentication-steps}
===============================================================================

Follow these steps to use the `Business Center` to enable customer authentication through Click to Pay. Authentication methods differ in each region and are dependent on the issuer, the cardholder device, and the Click to Pay configuration. These authentication methods are available:

* `3-D Secure`
* FIDO
* Card verification value (CVV)
* One-time password (OTP)

> IMPORTANT
> After you complete these steps, Relay determines which authentication method to use. When Relay determines that they will authenticate, they authenticate each Click to Pay transaction through the appropriate method. This may be a frictionless authentication or the customer may need to provide more information when required by the issuer. This is available only through Relay.
> IMPORTANT
> Relay Click to Pay authentication is not the same as consumer authentication using the complete mandate. See [Test Authentication](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-appendix-authentication.md "").

1. Log in to the `Business Center`:  
   Test URL: ` `<https://businesscentertest.example.com/ebc2>` `  
   Production URL: ` `<https://businesscenter.example.com>` `  
   If you are unable to access this page, contact your sales representative. {#uc-authentication-steps_step-1}
   {#uc-authentication-steps_step-1}

2. In the `Business Center`, go to the left navigation panel and choose **Payment Configuration** \&gt; **Unified Checkout**.  
   You must have Click to Pay enabled as a digital payment method in order to use this method of authentication. Click **Manage** to view the digital payment methods that you have enabled.

   If Click to Pay is not enabled, click **On** next to Click to Pay.

   {#uc-authentication-steps_step-2}

3. Click **Set up** under Value Added Solutions. The Value Added Solutions page appears.  
   ![Value Added Solutions Page](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/pmt-config-unified-payments-vas.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)

4. Click **Set up** to set up `3-D Secure`. The 3DS page appears.

5. Enter the required information in the Merchant Details section. You must enter the information that is provided to you by your acquirer or processor.  
   ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/pmt-config-unified-payments-3ds.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)

   #### Step Result

   This completes the authentication setup for the entered acquirer merchant ID and BIN. If you do not know what these values are, you must contact your acquirer. Completing this information enables `Payment Gateway` to send Relay the information that is required for authentication. IMPORTANT
   Charges for ` 3-D Secure ` may apply. You must speak with your acquirer for more information about the charges associated with ` 3-D Secure `.

Transient Tokens {#uc-tokens-intro}
===================================

The response to a successful customer interaction with `Unified Checkout` is a transient token. This is returned in the response from the checkout.mount() function. The transient token is a reference to the payment data collected on your behalf. Transient tokens allow secure card payments to occur without risk of exposure to sensitive payment information. The transient token is a short-term token that expires after 15 minutes. This reduces your PCI burden/responsibility and ensures that sensitive information is not exposed to your back-end systems.  
Transient tokens can be included requests sent to the Payment Details API for the customer payment data that is collected.

Mastercard `Click to Pay` Test Cards {#uc-reference-test-cards_mc-test-cards}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mastercard test cards can be added to your `Click to Pay` wallet. You must retrieve Mastercard test cards from their `Click to Pay` test page: [#test-cards](https://developer.mastercard.com/mastercard-checkout-solutions/documentation/testing/test_cases/click_to_pay_case/#test-cards "")  
Mastercard has different test cards for retrieving tokenized and non-tokenized data. `Payment Gateway` recommends that you use these test cards as follows:

* Test cards to retrieve PAN data: Use these cards when the customer is completing checkout as a one-time guest and does not have a `Click to Pay` account or want to create one.

* Test cards to retrieve token data: Use these cards for tokenized `Click to Pay` transactions.  
  You can manage your Mastercard `Click to Pay` test cards and account here:

* **Live:** [enroll](https://src.mastercard.com/profile/enroll "")

* **SBX:** [enroll](https://sandbox.src.mastercard.com/profile/enroll "")  
  To manage Mastercard test cards for customer authentication, contact your implementation consultant or technical account manager.

Echeck Test Values {#uc-reference-test-cards_echeck-test-vals}
--------------------------------------------------------------

These eCheck test values can be used to process a test eCheck transactions:

* **Routing number:** Set to 071923284
* **Account number:** Set to any supported value. For example, 1234567890.

Enrolling in Alternative Payment Methods {#uc-enable-altpay}
============================================================

Before you can enroll in alternative payment methods on `Unified Checkout`, you must first be enabled for the alternative payment platform. Contact your portfolio administrator for more information.

Managing Google Pay Authentication Types {#uc-enable-digital-pay-googlepay-manage-authentication}
=================================================================================================

Additional controls are available for Google Pay on `Unified Checkout`. When you enable Google Pay on `Unified Checkout`, you can specify optional parameters that define the types of card authentication you receive from Google Pay. To manage the types of credentials that Google Pay sends, use this expanded payment type object within the allowedPaymentTypes section of the sessions request:

```
"paymentConfigurations": {
    "GOOGLEPAY": {
      "allowedAuthMethods": "&lt;authentication type&gt;"
    }
```

The expanded payment type object has these parameters:

* type: Defines the type of payment option.
* options: Contains specific payment types parameters.  
  For Google Pay, use the new data element allowedAuthMethods within the options section of the payment types object to specify the authentication type you will receive from Google Pay. Possible values:
  * `PAN_ONLY`: Google returns primary account number (PAN) values
  * `CRYPTOGRAM_3DS`: Google returns fully authenticated network token values.
    By default, Google sends both authentication types.

  > IMPORTANT
  > When the complete mandate is used and Google Pay does not authenticate the transaction, then ` Unified Checkout ` completes the authentication request as part of the complete mandate.
  > REST Example: Specify Only PAN Authentication Accepted from Google  
  > This sessions request example specifies that Google Pay is to send only PAN values.

```
"allowedPaymentTypes": [
  "GOOGLEPAY"
],
"paymentConfigurations": {
    "GOOGLEPAY": {
      "allowedAuthMethods": [
        "PAN_ONLY",
        "CRYPTOGRAM_3DS"
      ]
    }
  }
```

REST Example: Simple Google Pay Request  
This sessions request example specifies that Google Pay can send all authentication types. This can be enabled and configured in the `Business Center`. For information about configuring your allowed payment types, see [Configure Payment Options](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-intro-payment-options.md "").

JavaScript Example: Displaying the Button List {#uc-getting-started-cs-js-button-example}
=========================================================================================

After you initialize the `Unified Checkout` object, you can add the payment application and payment acceptance pages to your webpage. You can attach the embedded `Unified Checkout` tool and payment acceptance pages to any named element within your HTML. Typically, they are attached to explicit named components that are replaced with `Unified Checkout`'s iframes.

```
// Sidebar
const result = await checkout.mount('#buttons');

// Embedded
const result = await checkout.mount({
  paymentSelection: '#buttons',
  paymentScreen: '#form'
});
```

`Click to Pay` UI Examples {#uc-appendix-ui-ux-ex}
==================================================

This section contains UI examples of how you should display `Click to Pay` on your payment page. For information about how to display the UI, see [JavaScript API Reference](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-appendix-js-reference.md "").

`Click to Pay` Replaces PAN Capture
-----------------------------------

`Click to Pay` is the card entry payment option within your payment page.

#### Figure: {#uc-appendix-ui-ux-ex_fig-ctp-ex1}

`Click to Pay` Replaces PAN Capture UI Example 1 ![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/ctp-ex1-645x375.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

`Click to Pay` as Radio Button
------------------------------

`Click to Pay` is a radio button for the card entry payment option within your payment page. When the cardholder selects this option, the `Click to Pay` payment flow is loaded.

#### Figure: {#uc-appendix-ui-ux-ex_fig-ctp-ex3}

`Click to Pay` Radio Button Example UI ![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/ctp-ex3-645x375.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

`Click to Pay` Icon on Radio Button
-----------------------------------

You can host the radio selection option for card payment with the `Click to Pay` icon displayed on the payment label. The `Unified Checkout` flow loads when the cardholder selects this option. For information about customizing how to trigger `Unified Checkout`, see [JavaScript Example: Client-Defined Trigger for Click to Pay or PAN Entry](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-getting-started-cs-js-trigger-ctp-pan-example.md "").

Load `Click to Pay` Automatically From Trigger
----------------------------------------------

You can load the `Unified Checkout` JavaScript flow within your payment page without requiring the cardholder to select a card payment option. This example shows a recognized user payment flow where the cardholder's information is shown automatically next to the other payment methods hosted within your payment page. For information about customizing how to trigger `Unified Checkout`, see [JavaScript Example: Client-Defined Trigger for Click to Pay or PAN Entry](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-getting-started-cs-js-trigger-ctp-pan-example.md "").

Card Payment Options with `Click to Pay` in UI
----------------------------------------------

Do not present the `Unified Checkout` payment button as a separate payment method from the card payment button. If you do this, the cardholder is not prompted with their `Click to Pay` cards and must manually enter their payment details. They will also not have the option to store their card within `Click to Pay` for future use.  
These examples show multiple card payment options and `Click to Pay` in a UI:

`Click to Pay` UI Guidelines {#uc-appendix-ui-ux}
=================================================

The UI that is built in `Unified Checkout` for `Click to Pay` is built based on the EMV `Click to Pay` XC Guidelines V1.1. `Unified Checkout` has simplified the integration of the UI. The only UI work that you must complete is the placement of the payment option.

> IMPORTANT
> You must include ` Click to Pay ` as one of the presented payment methods and not as a separate payment method.  
> `Unified Checkout` captures all card details that are manually entered by the cardholder. This enables the cardholder to enroll in `Click to Pay` and removes the requirement for the cardholder to manually enter their card details the next time they check out.  
> `Unified Checkout` provides a standard payment label in the `Unified Checkout` JavaScript that is loaded in your checkout page. One of these scenarios occurs when the cardholder selects the button:

* The cardholder is recognized.
* The cardholder is not recognized but has a `Click to Pay` account.
* The cardholder does not have a `Click to Pay` account.  
  You can also trigger the `Unified Checkout` flow using a custom button. If you are using your own custom button, your payment button or widget must display the `Click to Pay` image for the cardholder. For information about a custom button, see [JavaScript Example: Client-Defined Trigger for Click to Pay or PAN Entry](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-getting-started-cs-js-trigger-ctp-pan-example.md "").

> IMPORTANT
> Your implementation consultant will ask you for a mock-up of your payment flow for confirmation that it is compliant with the ` Click to Pay ` UI design standards.

Recognized `Click to Pay` Customer
----------------------------------

The cardholder is presented with their stored `Click to Pay` cards in the UI when they are on a recognized device:

#### Figure: {#uc-appendix-ui-ux_fig-ctp-recog-device}

Recognized `Click to Pay` Customer UI ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/ctp-recog-device-445x200.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Unrecognized `Click to Pay` Customer
------------------------------------

When the cardholder has a `Click to Pay` account but is not on a registered device, they receive a one-time password to their registered email address and phone number to authenticate their identity before their stored `Click to Pay` credentials are shown:

#### Figure: {#uc-appendix-ui-ux_fig-ctp-recog-account}

No `Click to Pay` Account
-------------------------

When the cardholder does not have a `Click to Pay` account, they can provide a new email address to perform a new lookup or they can choose to enter their card details manually. The cardholder can make a one-time payment or complete the payment and choose to create a `Click to Pay` account for future use:

#### Figure: {#uc-appendix-ui-ux_fig-ctp-no-account}

`Click to Pay` {#uc-pay-methods-dig-wallets-ctp}
================================================

`Click to Pay` is a secure online checkout method that enables customers to make purchases without entering their payment details for every purchase. This section includes information about accepting `Click to Pay` payments with your `Unified Checkout` integration.

Process Payments with `Unified Checkout` {#uc_pay_processing_intro}
===================================================================

Payment processing is a payment completion option in your merchant configuration. Your configuration determines if your checkout system automatically handles and finalizes customer payments. When payment processing is enabled, `Unified Checkout` handles the complete payment for you automatically. When payment processing not enabled, you complete payments independently using your selected gateway.

Payment Processing Enabled
--------------------------

`Payment Gateway` recommends that you enable payment processing if you meet these requirements:

* Your integration is configured with the payment completion step. For more information about completeMandate() see [Complete Mandate](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-cc-complete-mandate.md "").

* You do not have a designated technical team to process payments.

* Your integration includes any of these features:

  * Fraud checks with `Decision Manager` or `Fraud Management Essentials`
  * `3-D Secure`/ `Payer Authentication`
  * Stored customer credentials with the `Token Management Service`(`TMS`)
* Multiple payment methods  
  When payment processing is enabled, you can choose how payments should be handled:

* **Preferred Authorization**: The payment is authorized first and captured at a later time. This method works well for businesses that ship products to their customers. For example, you authorize the payment when the customer places and order and capture the payment when you ship it.

* **Sale**: The payment is captured immediately. This method works well for service businesses, digital products, and immediate purchases.

> IMPORTANT
> Not all payment methods are compatible with all processing types. Different payment methods work with different payment processing types. You must configure your payment processing settings to be compatible with your integration and review which payment methods are compatible. For information about payment methods and their processing compatibility, see [Payment Methods](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/uc-pay-methods-intro.md "").

Payment Processing Disabled
---------------------------

`Payment Gateway` recommends that you disable payment processing if you meet these requirements:

* You want to process payments on `our platform` using your own API requests instead of relying on the automatic payment completion step.
* You want full control over your checkout and payment orchestration flow.
* You only use `Unified Checkout` to collect encrypted payment information and you handle the completion phase through `our platform` APIs or your custom back-end. The completion phase includes authorization, sale, fraud checks, `3-D Secure` and card storage.

When disable payment processing, the checkout system will collect payment information from your customers but you will need to process the actual payment on your end. When payment processing is disabled, you must consider the following:

* Customer payments are not completed automatically.
* Fraud checks and `3-D Secure` using automatic orchestration are disabled.
* Saved credentials and token management using automatic processing are disabled.
* You must handle payment completion yourself.

JavaScript API Reference {#uc-appendix-js-reference-v1_api_reference}

   {#uc_intro_customer_data_step-2}

3. In the Customer data and payment flow section, click **Manage**. The Customer information and payment flow page appears.

4. Under Contact details, slide the toggle ( ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/ebc-ui-slide-bar-enabled-45x25.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original) ) next to Email address and Mobile phone number to collect the customer email address and phone number during checkout.

5. Under Payment details, slide the toggle ( ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/ebc-ui-slide-bar-enabled-45x25.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original) ) next to Billing address to collect the cardholder billing address.

6. Under Payment details, in the Billing address drop-down menu, select the billing address information for payment verification:

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Under Checkout review step, slide the toggle ( ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/ebc-ui-slide-bar-enabled-45x25.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original) ) to display a review page for the customer to confirm the payment and shipping address.

10. Under payment processing and \& service orchestration, slide the toggle ( ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/ebc-ui-slide-bar-enabled-45x25.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original) ) in the Payment processing section to control how to process transactions:  
    You can turn payment processing on or off:

      * **Preferred auth**: Choose this option to authorize the payment when possible.
      * **Sale**: Choose this option to capture the funds immediately.
    * **Payment Processing OFF**: You must complete the payment independently using CARD or another selected gateway.

You must include both the unifiedPayment.complete() object in the Javascript and the completeMandate field object in your capture context to enable `Unified Checkout` to initiate services on your behalf from the browser.

> IMPORTANT
> If you are updating an existing ` Unified Checkout ` configuration to use the complete mandate, you must update your JavaScript to include the unifedPayment.complete() function.
> IMPORTANT
> When the billingType field is set to ` NONE ` you must include the required fields within the capture context request to ensure that the required fields are included for payment processing. For information about the fields that are required for payment services, see the [Payments Developer Guide](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-intro.md "").

Captures {#uc-pay-methods-bnpl-captures}
========================================

When you set the completeMandate.type field value to `AUTH` or `PREFER_AUTH`, you must send a request to capture an authorized payment. Full and partial captures are supported.

Endpoint {#uc-pay-methods-bnpl-captures_d9e147}
-----------------------------------------------

**Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/pts/v2/payments/`*{id}*`/captures`{#uc-pay-methods-bnpl-captures_d9e156}  
**Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/pts/v2/payments/`*{id}*`/captures`{#uc-pay-methods-bnpl-captures_d9e169}  
The *{id}* is the transaction ID returned in the authorization response.

}
```

Response Status
---------------

`Payment Gateway` responds to your capture request with one of these statuses:

* `FAILED`: The capture request failed.
* `PENDING`: The capture request is accepted but not captured. Send a request to the check status service to retrieve status updates.
* `SETTLED`: The capture request is settled for the amount requested.

eCheck/ACH Service {#uc-pay-methods-echeck}
===========================================

`Unified Checkout` supports the acceptance of eCheck information. Sensitive eCheck data is securely captured and replaced with a token. Acceptance of eCheck information enables merchants to collect funds from a customer's bank account through both the ACH service and eCheck service (US only) for either of these flows:

* ACH services are a set of connections composed of the legacy gateway solutions where `Payment Gateway` serves as the gateway.

* eCheck, the new service on Payments 2.0, is the acquirer solution where `Payment Gateway` is the acquirer.  
  Unified Checkout replaces these eCheck information fields in your payment input form:

* Routing number

* Account number

* Account type (non-sensitive)

`Unified Checkout` Test Cards {#uc-reference-test-cards-uc}
===========================================================

Use these test card numbers to test your `Unified Checkout` configuration.  
Combine the BIN with the card number when sending to `Unified Checkout`.
To test `Payer Authentication`, you must use `Payer Authentication` test cards. See [Test Cases for 3-D Secure 2.x](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/payer-authentication/developer/all/rest/payer-auth/pa-testing-intro/pa-testing-3ds-2x-intro.md "") in the *`Payer Authentication` Developer Guide*.

[Card Support for the Complete Mandate]

Przelewy24\|P24 {#uc-pay-methods-obt-p24}
=========================================

Przelewy24, or P24, is a Poland-based real-time online bank transfer payment method. P24 is one of the most popular payment methods in Poland covering all major consumer banks.  
When the total amount of the order is outside the range of accepted transaction amounts, the P24 payment button is not displayed in `Unified Checkout`. These are the accepted transaction amounts:

* **Minimum transaction amount**: PLN 0.01, EUR 0.01
* **Maximum transaction amount**: PLN 55,000.00, EUR 12,500.00

Opt in to Przelewy24\|P24 on `Unified Checkout`
-----------------------------------------------

Follow these steps to opt in to Przelewy24\|P24 on `Unified Checkout`:

1. Add Przelewy24\|P24 to your integration by adding `PRZELEWY24` to the allowedPaymentTypes field object within the capture context request.
2. Set the completeMandate.type field value to `CAPTURE` or `PREFER_AUTH`.  
   You can capture the funds immediately if you include the completeMandate.type field in the capture context request and set the value to `CAPTURE`.  
   If you support more than one payment type and must perform an authorization where funds are collected at a later time, set the completeMandate.type field to `PREFER_AUTH`. The funds will be captured immediately for the online bank transfer.
3. Include these required fields for online bank transfers in the capture context request:
   * data.orderInformation.billTo.country
   * data.orderInformation.billTo.email
   * data.orderInformation.billTo.firstName
   * data.orderInformation.billTo.lastName
4. Include this optional field for online bank transfers in the capture context request:

* data.orderInformation.billTo.address1

Konbini {#uc-pay-methods-ppr-konbini}
=====================================

Konbini is used to make cash payments in Japan. Konbini payments enable your customers to pay for bills and online purchases at convenience stores in Japan.To complete a transaction, your customers receive payment codes for specific convenience stores and a confirmation number. Customers must then bring the information to a convenience store to make a cash payment. Your customers can pay at these convenience stores in Japan:

* 7-Eleven

* Family Mart

* Lawson

* Ministop

* Seicomart  
  You receive the payment confirmation immediately and the funds are available after 4 business days.  
  When the total amount of the order is outside the range of accepted transaction amounts, the Konbini payment button is not displayed in `Unified Checkout`. These are the accepted transaction amounts:

* **Minimum transaction amount**: JPY 1

* **Maximum transaction amount**: Not applicable

   You can perform a sale and capture the funds immediately if you include the completeMandate.type field in the capture context request and set the value to `CAPTURE`.  
   If you accept more than one payment type and must perform an authorization where funds are collected at a later time, set the completeMandate.type field to `PREFER_AUTH`. You must perform a capture using the payments API when an authorization is performed. A capture is performed automatically if an authorization is not allowed by the payment type.
3. Include these required fields in the capture context request:
   * data.orderInformation.billTo.country
   * data.orderInformation.billTo.firstName
   * data.orderInformation.billTo.lastName

Post-Pay Reference Payments {#uc-pay-methods-ppr}
=================================================

Post-pay reference payments provide an alternative way for your customers to complete online purchases using cash. During checkout, customers select a voucher payment option and receive a unique code or payment slip. To finalize their purchase, they visit a designated offline location, such as a convenience store or payment kiosk, and pay the required amount in person. Once the payment is made, the merchant receives a notification that they can process the order.  
Post-pay reference payments are widely used in countries where cash transactions are common or where many customers don't have access to credit or debit cards.

> IMPORTANT
> Before you can enroll in these alternative payment method on ` Unified Checkout `, you must first be enabled for the alternative payment platform. Contact your portfolio administrator for more information.  
> This is how post-pay reference payments work:  
> ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/unified-checkout/images/uc-ap-ppr-650x175.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The customer selects a convenience store/voucher payment method during checkout.
2. The customer receives their payment code/voucher or QR code.
3. The customer presents the payment code/voucher or QR in-store to complete the payment.
4. The customer receives a notification that the payment is complete.  
   `Unified Checkout` supports the Konbini voucher-based payment option:

| Payment Method | Capture Context allowedPaymentTypes | Capture Context completeMandate.type | Separate Capture? | Payment Confirmation | Customer Country (Country Code) | Customer ISO Currency Code |

[Summary of v0 and v1 Changes]

Initialization {#uc_v1_migration_intro_section_xzp_pbt_hjc}
-----------------------------------------------------------

Initialization with `Click to Pay Drop-In UI` v1 is done in a single asynchronous factory call. There is no intermediate `Accept` object: v0 Initialization

```
const accept = new Accept(sessionJWT);
const up = accept.unifiedPayments();
```

{#uc_v1_migration_intro_codeblock_zzp_pbt_hjc} v1 Initialization

```
const client = await VAS.UnifiedCheckout(sessionJWT);
```

{#uc_v1_migration_intro_codeblock_b1q_pbt_hjc} `Unified Checkout` v1 validates the JWT signature and target origins during initialization.

Display the Payment UI {#uc_v1_migration_intro_section_d1q_pbt_hjc}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

`Unified Checkout` v1 passes your UI payment selectors directly to `mount()`. v0 Display Payment UI with `show()`

```
// Sidebar
const token = await up.show({
  containers: {
    paymentSelection: '#buttons'
  }
});

// Embedded
const token = await up.show({
  containers: {
    paymentSelection: '#buttons',
    paymentScreen: '#form'
  }
});
```

{#uc_v1_migration_intro_codeblock_f1q_pbt_hjc} v1 Display Payment UI with `mount()`

```
// Sidebar
const result = await checkout.mount('#buttons');

// Embedded
const result = await checkout.mount({
  paymentSelection: '#buttons',
  paymentScreen: '#form'
});
```

{#uc_v1_migration_intro_codeblock_h1q_pbt_hjc}

Events {#uc_v1_migration_intro_section_n1q_pbt_hjc}
---------------------------------------------------

`Unified Checkout` v0 does not include an event system, as the integration resolution or rejection from `show()` and `complete()`. v1 includes a full event system as the client and integration levels. v1 Full Event System

```
// Client-level — centralized error tracking
client.on('error', (err) =&gt; {
  console.error(`[${err.source}] ${err.code}: ${err.message}`);
});

// Checkout-level — granular lifecycle events
checkout.on('ready', (data) =&gt; {
  console.log('Available methods:', data.availablePaymentMethods);
});

checkout.on('paymentMethodSelected', (data) =&gt; {
  console.log('Selected:', data.type);
});

checkout.on('error', (err) =&gt; {
  console.error('Checkout error:', err.code);
});
```

{#uc_v1_migration_intro_codeblock_p1q_pbt_hjc}

Cleanup {#uc_v1_migration_intro_section_q1q_pbt_hjc}
----------------------------------------------------

`Unified Checkout` v1 distinguishes between `unmount()`, which is reversible, and `destroy()`, which is permanent. Before a cleanup, `client.destroy()` sends a `destroyed` event. v0 Cleanup

```
up.hide();     // Hide UI
up.dispose();  // Clean up resources
```

{#uc_v1_migration_intro_codeblock_s1q_pbt_hjc} v1 Cleanup

```
checkout.unmount();   // Remove UI from page (can remount later)
checkout.destroy();   // Permanent cleanup

client.destroy();     // Destroy client and clear all event listeners
```

{#uc_v1_migration_intro_codeblock_u1q_pbt_hjc}

Handle Errors {#uc_v1_migration_intro_section_v1q_pbt_hjc}
----------------------------------------------------------

The `UnifiedCheckoutError` class and its reason codes are the same in v0 and v1: v0 Error Handling

```
try {
  const token = await up.show({
    containers: {
      paymentSelection: '#buttons'
    }
  });
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err.reason, err.message);
}
```

{#uc_v1_migration_intro_codeblock_x1q_pbt_hjc} v1 Error Handling

```
// Same error class, same properties
try {
  const result = await checkout.mount('#buttons');
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err.reason, err.message);
}
```

{#uc_v1_migration_intro_codeblock_z1q_pbt_hjc}

Migrate Triggers {#uc_v1_migration_intro_section_abq_pbt_hjc}
-------------------------------------------------------------

If your `Unified Checkout` v0 integration uses triggers, the migration is similar to checkout. In v1, triggers are created from the` client.createTrigger`, not from `UnifiedPayments` as in v0. In v1, `show()` is renamed to `mount()`. v0 Triggers

```
const trigger = up.createTrigger('CLICKTOPAY', {
  containers: { paymentScreen: '#screen' }
});
const token = await trigger.show();
```

{#uc_v1_migration_intro_codeblock_cbq_pbt_hjc} v1 Triggers

```
const trigger = client.createTrigger('CLICKTOPAY');
const result = await trigger.mount('#screen');
```

{#uc_v1_migration_intro_codeblock_ebq_pbt_hjc}

Update Reason Codes {#uc_v1_migrate_reason_codes}
=================================================

Some reason codes were renamed in v1. This table shows the v0 reason code name and the corresponding name in the v1 client-side SDK:

|            v0 Reason Code             |        v1 Reason Code         |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `SHOW_LOAD_CONTAINER_SELECTOR`        | `MOUNT_CONTAINER_SELECTOR`    |
| `SHOW_LOAD_ERROR`                     | `MOUNT_ERROR`                 |
| `SHOW_LOAD_INVALID_CONTAINER`         | `MOUNT_INVALID_CONTAINER`     |
| `SHOW_LOAD_SIDEBAR_OPTIONS`           | `MOUNT_SIDEBAR_OPTIONS`       |
| `SHOW_PAYMENT_TIMEOUT`                | `MOUNT_PAYMENT_TIMEOUT`       |
| `SHOW_PAYMENT_UNAVAILABLE`            | `MOUNT_PAYMENT_UNAVAILABLE`   |
| `SHOW_TOKEN_TIMEOUT`                  | `MOUNT_TOKEN_TIMEOUT`         |
| `SHOW_TOKEN_XHR_ERROR`                | `MOUNT_TOKEN_XHR_ERROR`       |
| `UNIFIED_PAYMENTS_ALREADY_SHOWN`      | `CHECKOUT_ALREADY_MOUNTED`    |
| `UNIFIED_PAYMENTS_PAYMENT_PARAMETERS` | `CHECKOUT_PAYMENT_PARAMETERS` |
| `UNIFIED_PAYMENTS_VALIDATION_PARAMS`  | `CHECKOUT_VALIDATION_PARAMS`  |

> IMPORTANT
> The server-side API continues to return these v0 reason codes. The v1 reason codes listed here are used only in the client-side SDK. For all v1 client-side error codes, see [Handle Errors](/docs/gateway/en-us/click-to-pay/developer/all/rest/click-to-pay/ctp-testing-intro/ctp-handle-errors.md "").

Version 1 Update Checklist {#uc_v1_migration_checklist}
=======================================================

You must complete these tasks before you can complete your migration from `Unified Checkout` v0 to v1:

* Replace `new Accept(session).unifiedPayments()` with `await VAS.UnifiedCheckout(session)`.
* Replace `up.show(options)` with `checkout = await client.createCheckout(); checkout.mount(target)`.
* Update container options: `{ containers: { paymentSelection, paymentScreen } }` becomes direct arguments to `mount()`.
* Replace `up.complete(token)` with `checkout.complete(token)` or use `autoProcessing: true` to complete transactions automatically
* Replace `up.hide()` with `checkout.unmount()`.
* Replace `up.dispose()` with `checkout.destroy()` and `client.destroy()`.
* Add event listeners for observability. For example, `client.on('error')` and `checkout.on('ready')`.

CARD Platform Connect: Specifications and Conditions for Resellers/Partners {#vpc-partner-reseller-disclaimer}
==============================================================================================================

The following are specifications and conditions that apply to a Reseller/Partner enabling its merchants through Payment Gateway for Platform Connect ("VPC") processing. Failure to meet any of the specifications and conditions below is subject to the liability provisions and indemnification obligations under Reseller/Partner's contract with Relay/Payment Gateway.

1. Before boarding merchants for payment processing on a VPC acquirer's connection, Reseller/Partner and the VPC acquirer must have a contract or other legal agreement that permits Reseller/Partner to enable its merchants to process payments with the acquirer through the dedicated VPC connection and/or traditional connection with such VPC acquirer.
2. Reseller/Partner is responsible for boarding and enabling its merchants in accordance with the terms of the contract or other legal agreement with the relevant VPC acquirer.
3. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that all considerations and fees associated with chargebacks, interchange downgrades, settlement issues, funding delays, and other processing related activities are strictly between Reseller and the relevant VPC acquirer.
4. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that the relevant VPC acquirer is responsible for payment processing issues, including but not limited to, transaction declines by network/issuer, decline rates, and interchange qualification, as may be agreed to or outlined in the contract or other legal agreement between Reseller/Partner and such VPC acquirer.

DISCLAIMER: NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS BY THE Platform Connect ACQUIRER IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS. NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR RESELLER/PARTNER BOARDING MERCHANTS OR ENABLING MERCHANT PROCESSING IN VIOLATION OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE RELEVANT Platform Connect ACQUIRER.

Add Merchant Account Information {#boarding-merchants-v2-add-merch-acct-info}
=============================================================================

Follow these steps to add merchant account information:

1. In Basic Information, enter the merchant account name and the organization ID in the provided text fields.

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   * The merchant account name is the name of the business.
   * The organization ID is the name or identifier of the account that you are creating. It must be unique, not just in the portfolio or account, but in the system.
2. Enter the merchant information in the provided text fields. Required fields are noted with an asterisk (\*).

3. Click **Save** . You are returned to the Add Merchant page. You can skip the optional hierarchy step by clicking **Skip**.

JSON Web Tokens {#uc-appendix-jwts}
===================================

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are digitally signed JSON objects based on the open standard [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519 ""). These tokens provide a compact, self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties. These tokens are signed with an RSA-encoded public/private key pair. The signature is calculated using the header and body, which enables the receiver to validate that the content has not been tampered with.  
A JWT takes the form of a string, and consists of three parts separated by dots:

```
&lt;Header&gt;.&lt;Payload&gt;.&lt;Signature&gt;
```

The header and payload is **Base64-encoded JSON** and contains these claims:

* **Header** : The algorithm and token type. For example:

  ```
  {
    "kid": "zu",
    "alg": "RS256"
  }
  ```
* **Payload** : The claims of what the token represents. For example:

  ```
  {
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "iat": 1516239022
  }
  ```
* **Signature**: The signature is computed from the header and payload using a secret or private key.

{#uc-appendix-jwts_ul_ozy_ysn_4pb}

> IMPORTANT
> When working with JWTs, ` Payment Gateway ` recommends that you use a well- maintained JWT library to ensure proper decoding and parsing of the JWT.  
> IMPORTANT When parsing the JWT's JSON payload, you must ensure that you implement a robust solution for transversing JSON. Additional elements can be added to the JSON in future releases. Follow JSON parsing best practices to ensure that you can handle the addition of new data elements in the future.

Set Up the Transacting Organization and Products {#boarding-merchants-v2-add-merch-trans-org-prod}
