Introduction to Relay Bank Account Validation {#relay-bank-acc-val-topic-intro}
=============================================================================

`Payment Gateway` offers the Relay Bank Account Validation product, which helps validate your customer's routing and bank account information as a standalone service through secure REST-based API prior to generating an ACH transaction with your existing processor. This product also helps you comply with the National Automated Clearing House Association (Nacha) Web Debit Account Validation Rule for ACH web transactions.  
This product helps reduce the number of administrative returns, enhances the security and reliability of ACH transactions, and protects your business from the costly repercussions of invalid ACH transactions.  
The Relay Bank Account Validation product validates both the routing and bank account number based on the ACH history of the account. The responses on this validation will let you know whether the customer's account is validated, not validated, low risk, medium risk, or high risk for processing ACH transactions. The product validates a routing and bank account number combination using format checks and historical information based on more than 100 million accounts.

Requirements for Relay Bank Account Validation {#relay-bank-acc-val-reqs}
=======================================================================

In the US, Relay Bank Account Validation enables you to validate your customer's routing and bank account information based on their ACH history. Before you can start using it, you must meet these requirements:

* Verify that you have the capability to use the REST API.
* Contact the `Payment Gateway` sales team or your contracting partner to request onboarding for the Relay Bank Account Validation product.
* Generate a `REST` key P12 certificate for your merchant ID (MID) so that you can send requests. For more information, see [Generating a P12 Certificate](/docs/gateway/en-us/relay-bank-validation/merchant/all/rest/relay-bank-accoun-val/relay-bank-acc-val-config.md "").
* Enable Message-Level Encryption (MLE) so that you can send all Relay Bank Account Validation API requests, including requests submitted using tokenized data to `Payment Gateway`. For more information, see [Enabling Message-Level Encryption](/docs/gateway/en-us/relay-bank-validation/merchant/all/rest/relay-bank-accoun-val/relay-bank-acc-val-enable-mle.md "").
  {#relay-bank-acc-val-reqs_ul_a1g_yvv_52c}

Generating a P12 Certificate {#relay-bank-acc-val-config}
========================================================

You can use this validation product only through a REST API integration.  
You must create a `REST` key for your merchant ID. If you already have a `REST` key for other `Payment Gateway` `REST` services with the same merchant ID, you can use that key to access the Relay Bank Account Validation Service. Ensure that the key is a P12 certificate. For more details, see [Create a P12 Certificate](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-jwt-message-intro/restgs-security-p12-intro.md "") in the *Getting Started with REST Developer Guide*.

Enabling Message-Level Encryption {#relay-bank-acc-val-enable-mle}
=================================================================

You must enable Message-Level Encryption (MLE) to send Relay Bank Account Validation API requests to `Payment Gateway`. For more information, see [Enable Message-Level Encryption](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-jwt-message-intro/restgs-mle-intro.md "") in the *Getting Started with REST Developer Guide*.

Validating a Bank Account {#relay-bank-acc-val-process-intro-intro}
==================================================================

Relay Bank Account Validation supports multiple invocation methods as explained in the following sub-sections.

> IMPORTANT  
> Each request can validate either the routing and bank account number combination or one of the types of token can be validated. You cannot combine multiple tokens or routing/bank account information in a single request.

Validate an Account Using Routing and Account Numbers {#relay-bank-acc-val-process-intro}
========================================================================================

Validating an Account Using Transient Tokens {#concept_nt2_ymx_z3c}
===================================================================

Transient tokens are one-time, short-lived tokens, Merchants can use them for validations without having to transmit raw routing and account number data in the API request call. This option is intended for session-based validations, such as initial account verification or checkout flows. There are several types of transient tokens that can be used when validating routing and bank account information.  
All transient token-based account validation requests must be submitted using REST APIs secured with mandatory Message‑Level Encryption (MLE).  
The validation response returned for transient token requests is the same as for other Relay Bank Account Validation request types.
