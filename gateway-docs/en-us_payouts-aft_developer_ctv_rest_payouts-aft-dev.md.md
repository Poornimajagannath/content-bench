CARD Platform Connect: Specifications and Conditions for Resellers/Partners {#vpc-partner-reseller-disclaimer}
==============================================================================================================

The following are specifications and conditions that apply to a Reseller/Partner enabling its merchants through Payment Gateway for Platform Connect ("VPC") processing. Failure to meet any of the specifications and conditions below is subject to the liability provisions and indemnification obligations under Reseller/Partner's contract with Relay/Payment Gateway.

1. Before boarding merchants for payment processing on a VPC acquirer's connection, Reseller/Partner and the VPC acquirer must have a contract or other legal agreement that permits Reseller/Partner to enable its merchants to process payments with the acquirer through the dedicated VPC connection and/or traditional connection with such VPC acquirer.
2. Reseller/Partner is responsible for boarding and enabling its merchants in accordance with the terms of the contract or other legal agreement with the relevant VPC acquirer.
3. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that all considerations and fees associated with chargebacks, interchange downgrades, settlement issues, funding delays, and other processing related activities are strictly between Reseller and the relevant VPC acquirer.
4. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that the relevant VPC acquirer is responsible for payment processing issues, including but not limited to, transaction declines by network/issuer, decline rates, and interchange qualification, as may be agreed to or outlined in the contract or other legal agreement between Reseller/Partner and such VPC acquirer.

DISCLAIMER: NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS BY THE CARD PLATFORM CONNECT ACQUIRER IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS. NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR RESELLER/PARTNER BOARDING MERCHANTS OR ENABLING MERCHANT PROCESSING IN VIOLATION OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE RELEVANT CARD PLATFORM CONNECT ACQUIRER.

AFT Transactions {#payouts-services-intro}
==========================================

The Account Funding Transaction (AFT) allows the transfer of funds between a payment card and another account, including payment cards. When used independently, an AFT can only be used to transfer funds between accounts owned by the same individual or business entity. An AFT is not intended for the payment of goods and services, funding a merchant account, or for debt repayment.

Dual Message Account Funding Transactions (AFTs) {#payouts-services-auth-dual-message-aft-intro}
================================================================================================

Account Funding Transactions allow a payment service provider to debit funds from a cardholder's Mastercard or Relay account to fund a non-merchant account. This is typically used to load funds onto prepaid cards and electronic wallets.  
Dual Message Account Funding Transactions (AFTs) provide the following benefits:

* Enables customers to identify Mastercard and Relay transactions during the authorization and settlement.
* Allows acquiring partners to use Dual Message BINs when performing a payout transaction.

> IMPORTANT
> You must receive prior approval from ` Platform Connect ` before using the AFT services. Contact ` Platform Connect ` to register in the AFT program.

Dual Message Account Funding Transactions (AFTs) with Relay Secure for Merchant Aggregators {#payouts-services-auth-dual-message-aft-vs-agg-intro}
=================================================================================================================================================

Account Funding Transactions allow a payment service provider to debit funds from a cardholder's Mastercard or Relay account to fund a non-merchant account. This is typically used to load funds onto prepaid cards and electronic wallets.  
Dual Message Account Funding Transactions (AFTs) provide the following benefits:

* Enables customers to identify Mastercard and Relay transactions during the authorization and settlement.
* Allows acquiring partners to use Dual Message BINs when performing a payout transaction.
* Enables users to safely validate their identity and safely store their personal identity.

Dual Message Account Funding Transactions (AFTs) with Network Tokens {#payouts-services-auth-dual-message-aft-token-intro}
==========================================================================================================================

Account Funding Transactions allow a payment service provider to debit funds from a cardholder's Mastercard or Relay account to fund a non-merchant account. This is typically used to load funds onto prepaid cards and electronic wallets.  
Dual Message Account Funding Transactions (AFTs) with Network Tokens provide the following benefits:

* Enables customers to identify Mastercard and Relay transactions during the authorization and settlement.
* Allows acquiring partners to use Dual Message BINs when performing a payout transaction.
* Increases the security with payout transactions.
* Decreases the chances of fraudulent transactions

Dual Message Account Funding Transactions (AFTs) to Establish a Recurring Payout Transaction (CIT) {#payouts-services-auth-dual-message-aft-cit-intro}
======================================================================================================================================================

Account Funding Transactions allow a payment service provider to debit funds from a cardholder's Mastercard or Relay account to fund a non-merchant account. This is typically used to load funds onto prepaid cards and electronic wallets.  
Dual Message Account Funding Transactions (AFTs) provide the following benefits:

* Enables customers to identify Mastercard and Relay transactions during the authorization and settlement.
* Allows acquiring partners to use Dual Message BINs when performing a payout transaction.

Using the credential-on-file transactions, customers can set up recurring transfers, for example transferring $50 to the customer's wallet each month. To set up such a transaction, the customer needs to create a Customer Inititated Transaction (CIT) that establishes the frequency, amount and duration of the recurring transfer. This information is then saved so that follow on Merchant Initiated Transactions (MITs) can occur on the customer's behalf.

Dual Message Account Funding Transactions (AFTs) for a Recurring Payout Transaction (MIT) {#payouts-services-auth-dual-message-aft-mit-intro}
=============================================================================================================================================

Account Funding Transactions allow a payment service provider to debit funds from a cardholder's Mastercard or Relay account to fund a non-merchant account. This is typically used to load funds onto prepaid cards and electronic wallets.  
Dual Message Account Funding Transactions (AFTs) provide the following benefits:

* Enables customers to identify Mastercard and Relay transactions during the authorization and settlement.
* Allows acquiring partners to use Dual Message BINs when performing a payout transaction.

Using the credential-on-file transactions, customers can set up recurring transfers, for example transferring $50 to the customer's wallet each month. To set up such a transaction, the customer needs to create a Customer Inititated Transaction (CIT) that establishes the frequency, amount and duration of the recurring transfer. This information is then saved so that follow on Merchant Initiated Transactions (MITs) can occur on the customer's behalf.

Appendix C: Relay BAI to Mastercard TTI Mapping {#payouts-appendix-mapping}
==========================================================================

These are the Relay BAI to Mastercard TTI mapping and their descriptions for different regions and transaction types.

Handling Wallet Transfer MCC Across All Regions
-----------------------------------------------

**Relay Business Application Identifier (BAI)** : `WT`: Wallet transfer  
**Mastercard Transaction Type Indicator (TTI)** : `F61`  
**Description**:  
Mastercard specifies Merchant Category Codes (MCC) to retain Account Funding Wallet Transfers.  
These are the MCCs:

* `6051` (Quasi-Cash: Merchant): The account provider's primary activity is buying and selling cryptocurrency.

* `6211` (Securities-Brokers/Dealers): The account provider's primary activity is purchasing, selling, or brokering high-risk securities.

* `7800`/`7801`/`7994`/`7995`/`9406` (gaming and gambling): The account provider's primary activity is gaming or gambling.

* `6540` (Default `WT` MCC): Participants use the mentioned MCC for all other use cases for Transfers to Own Staged Digital Wallet Accounts.
  {#payouts-appendix-mapping_ul_q53_q1l_rdc}
  NOTE Acquirers must adjust the mapping accordingly to clear the file to align with the Auth MCC, and ensure accurate clearing and compliance.  
  The system will automatically overwrite the MCC in these scenarios if mapping is not adjusted:

* When the client includes BAI as `WT` and MCC as `6051`, and the Transaction Purpose is `16` (securities), the system will set the TTI to `F61` and the MCC to `6211`.

* When the client includes BAI as `WT` and MCC as `6051`, and the Transaction Purpose is `11` (cryptocurrency), the system will set the TTI to `F61` and retain the MCC as `6051`.

* When the merchant sends `6051` for any other transaction purpose, the system will replace the MCC with `6540`.

* When you send MCCs other than the ones mentioned above, the system will overwrite them to `6540`.

Handling Account to Account and Funds Transfer MCC for Non-Asia Pacific Region {#payouts-appendix-mapping_section_ltn_y1l_rdc}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Relay Business Application Identifier (BAI)** : `FT`: Funds Transfer  
**Mastercard Transaction Type Indicator (TTI)** : `F52`

* `4829` (Default Funding Transactions): Participants use the mentioned MCC for all other use cases for Account to Account and Funds Transfer.
  {#payouts-appendix-mapping_ul_gmy_cbl_rdc}
  NOTE Acquirers must adjust the mapping accordingly to clear the file to align with the Auth MCC, and ensure accurate clearing and compliance.  
  The system will automatically overwrite the MCC if mapping is not adjusted when you send MCCs other than the ones mentioned above. The system will overwrite them to `4829`.

  {#payouts-appendix-mapping_ul_sbj_jbl_rdc}
  NOTE Acquirers must adjust the mapping accordingly to clear the file to align with the Auth MCC, and ensure accurate clearing and compliance.  
  The system will automatically overwrite the MCC if mapping is not adjusted when you send MCCs other than the ones mentioned above. The system will overwrite them to `6540`.

  {#payouts-appendix-mapping_ul_nld_4bl_rdc}
  NOTE Acquirers must adjust the mapping accordingly to clear the file to align with the Auth MCC, and ensure accurate clearing and compliance.  
  The system will automatically overwrite the MCC if mapping is not adjusted when you send MCCs other than the ones mentioned above. The system will overwrite them to `6540`.

Handling Person to Person to Card Account Transactions MCC Across Regions {#payouts-appendix-mapping_section_rfl_pbl_rdc}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Person-to-person to card account**: When a merchant conducts a person-to-person transaction and provides both the recipient's account type and account ID, the system classifies the transaction as a Person-to-Person to Card Account transaction. Then the system will apply the specified MCC.  
This is the MCC:

* `4829` (Money Transfer): Customers transfer funds via electronic funds transfer/wire transfer/remittance to a named entity (both card-present and card-absent locations, including on-premises of the merchant and third-party agents).
  {#payouts-appendix-mapping_ul_a3d_rbl_rdc}
  NOTE Acquirers must adjust the mapping accordingly to clear the file to align with the Auth MCC, and ensure accurate clearing and compliance.  
  The system will automatically overwrite the MCC if mapping is not adjusted when you send MCCs other than the ones mentioned above, the system will overwrite them to `6540`.

> NOTE
> Account Identifier Type and value are required for TTI ` F08 `. If the you send the transaction without this data, the system will map it as general person-to-person with TTI ` F07 ` (MCC ` 4829 ` will be sent as is to Mastercard, and all others will map to ` 6540 `).
