Introduction {#googpay-intro}
=============================

You can use the `Payment Gateway` platform to process and manage Google Pay transactions.

Google Pay Overview
-------------------

Google Pay is a simple, secure in-app mobile and Web payment solution. You can choose `Payment Gateway` to process Google Pay transactions through all e-commerce channels.  
You can simplify your payment processing by allowing `Payment Gateway` to decrypt the payment data for you during processing.  
This method integrates simply and enables you to process transactions without seeing the payment network token and transaction data.

1. Using the Google API, request the customer's encrypted payment data.
2. Using the `Payment Gateway` API, construct and submit the authorization request, and include the encrypted payment data from the Google Pay callback.
3. `Payment Gateway` decrypts the encrypted payment data to create the payment network token and processes the authorization request.

Payment Network Tokens {#googpay-pmnt-network-tokens}
=====================================================

Authorizations with payment network tokens enable you to securely request a payment transaction with a payment network token instead of a customer's primary account number (PAN).  
The payment network token is included in the customer's encrypted payment data, which is returned by the payment processor.

Prerequisite Requirements {#googpay-requirements}
=================================================

Before using Google Pay, you must have:

* A `Payment Gateway` merchant evaluation account.
  * To register, go to: [https://developer.example.com/hello-world/sandbox.html](https://developer.example.com/hello-world/sandbox.md "")
* A [merchant evaluation account](https://ebc2.example.com/ebc2/registration/external "") with a supported processor. See [Supported Processors](/docs/gateway/en-us/google-pay/developer/ctv/rest/googlepay/googpay-intro/googpay-processors.md "").
* The `Payment Gateway` `REST API` Client installed on your system.
* A Google developer account.
* Google Pay APIs embedded into your application or website. For details about integrating Google Pay, see the [Google Pay API](https://developers.google.com/pay/api "") documentation.

How Google Pay Works {#googpay-how-it-works}
============================================

The following figure describes the Google Pay workflow:  
![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/googlepay/images/trans_flow.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The customer chooses the Google Pay button. Using the Google API, your system initiates the Google Pay request identifying `Payment Gateway` as your payment gateway, passing your `Payment Gateway` merchant ID as the gateway merchant ID.
2. The customer confirms the payment. The Google API contacts Google Pay services to retrieve the consumer's payment parameters.
3. If the customer's selected payment credentials are tokenized, or you are tokenizing new payment credentials, the Google Pay service contacts the appropriate payment network to retrieve the appropriate cryptogram.
4. The payment network returns the appropriate token and cryptogram to the Google Pay service.
5. Google creates encrypted payment data using the gateway-specific key that is supplied in the Wallet request and includes it in the Google API response.
6. The Google Pay callback returns the encrypted payment data.
7. Your system prepares the Google Pay response information for submission to the `Payment Gateway` service.
8. 1. `Payment Gateway` sends the authorization request to the acquirer.
   2. The acquirer processes the request from `Payment Gateway` and creates the payment network authorization request.
   3. The payment network processes the request from the acquirer and creates the issuer authorization request.
   4. The issuer processes the request from the payment network. The issuer looks up the payment information and returns an approved or declined authorization message to the payment network.
   5. The payment network returns the authorization response to the acquirer.
   6. The acquirer returns the authorization response to `Payment Gateway`.
9. `Payment Gateway` returns the authorization response to your system.
10. Your system returns the authorization response to the payment application.
11. The payment application displays the confirmation or decline message to the customer.
    1. The acquirer submits the settlement request to the issuer for funds.
12. The issuer supplies the funds to the acquirer for the authorized transactions.

Additional Services {#googpay-avail-svcs}
=========================================

These additional services can be used with Google Pay.

Follow-on Services
------------------

After the authorization is requested, you can request follow-on services to complete the transaction. For more information on these services, see [Follow-on Services](/docs/gateway/en-us/google-pay/developer/ctv/rest/googlepay/googpay-follow-on-intro.md "").

Authorized Reversal
:
An authorized reversal is a follow-on service that uses the request ID returned from the previous authorization. An authorization reversal releases the hold that the authorization placed on the customer's credit card funds. Use this service to reverse an unnecessary or undesired authorization.

Capture
:
A capture is a follow-on service that uses the request ID returned from the previous authorization. The request ID links the capture to the authorization. This service transfers funds from the customer's account to your bank and usually takes two to four days to complete.

Sale
:
A sale is a bundled authorization and capture. Request the authorization and capture services at the same time. `Payment Gateway` processes the capture immediately.

Follow-on Transactions {#id_ltm_ltt_gyb}
----------------------------------------

After the payment transaction is complete, additional follow-on transactions can be made as Merchant-Initiated Transactions (MITs).  
For more information on how to process MITs, see [Merchant-Initiated Transactions](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/credentials/credentials-mit-intro.md "").  
MITs include:

* Delayed Authorizations
* Incremental Transactions
* Installment Payments
* No-Show Transactions
* Reauthorizations
* Recurring Transactions
* Resubmissions
* Unscheduled Transactions
  {#id_ltm_ltt_gyb_d12e28}

Formatting Encrypted Payment Data {#googpay-pay-data-intro}
===========================================================

This section shows you how to format encrypted payment data using these procedures:

* [Configuring Google Pay](/docs/gateway/en-us/google-pay/developer/ctv/rest/googlepay/googpay-pay-data-intro/googpay-pay-data-config.md "")
* [Formatting Payment Blobs](/docs/gateway/en-us/google-pay/developer/ctv/rest/googlepay/googpay-pay-data-intro/googpay-pay-data-formatting-blobs.md "")
  {#googpay-pay-data-intro_ul_kkj_ckx_1xb}

Configuring Google Pay {#googpay-pay-data-config}
=================================================

You must provide your `Payment Gateway` merchant ID to Google in order to ensure proper encryption of the Google Pay payload and authenticity of the request.  
For a Google Pay tutorial, see [Google Pay for Payments](https://developers.google.com/pay/api "").  
Set the gateway and gateway merchant ID to the appropriate indicators. The following code examples show how to configure the PaymentMethodTokenizationParameters object using `Payment Gateway` as the gateway.  
Example: Java Code

```keyword
.setPaymentMethodTokenizationType(WalletConstants.PAYMENT_METHOD_TOKENIZATION_TYPE_PAYMENT_GATEWAY)
     .addParameter("gateway", "")
     .addParameter("gatewayMerchantId", "[yourPayment GatewayMID]")
```

Example: JavaScript Code

```keyword
tokenizationType: 'PAYMENT_GATEWAY',
     parameters: {
     gateway: 'payment-gateway',
          gatewayMerchantId: '[yourPayment GatewayMID]'
```

Formatting Payment Blobs {#googpay-pay-data-formatting-blobs}
=============================================================

> IMPORTANT
> This section is only applicable if you are using the ` Payment Gateway ` decryption method.  
> To prepare the Google Pay payload for submission to `Payment Gateway`, you must extract the token data element from the Google Pay payload and encode the token data element using Base64.  
> These samples can be used to Base64-encode payment responses:  
> JavaScript

```
let token = paymentData.paymentMethodData.tokenizationData.token;
console.log(token);
var enc=window.btoa(token);
```

Android with Java  
This sample uses the Android Studio Base64 utility.

```
public static &lt;outputString&gt; encodeToString (byte[] &lt;inputToken&gt;, int DEFAULT)
```

Apple iPhone with Swift 3  
This sample requires the Foundation utility.

```
extension String {
     func base64Encoded() -&gt; &lt;outputString&gt;
          if let data = self.dat(using:.utf8) {
               return data.base64EncodedString()
          }
          return nil
}
```

Authorization Reversal {#payments-processing-basic-auth-reversal-intro}
=======================================================================

This section provides the information about how to process an authorization reversal.  
Reversing an authorization releases the hold on the customer's payment card funds that the issuing bank placed when processing the authorization.  
For a debit card or prepaid card in which only a partial amount was approved, the amount of the reversal must be the amount that was authorized, not the amount that was requested.

Supported Card Types
--------------------

All supported card types can process reversals.
