Introduction to Card Present Connect \| Retail {#cp-intro-cpc}
==============================================================

Card Present Connect \| Retail is part of a unified commerce solution for payment technology providers. This solution supports card-present transactions at the point of sale (POS) and on mobile POS devices. It also enables you to integrate with multiple processors and acquirers.  
The platform uses end-to-end encryption to enable secure and innovative payment solutions. Retail integration and value-added services are available through a single integration on the Card Present Connect payment management platform.  
An added benefit of Card Present Connect \| Retail is that you can streamline Platform Connect certification, which helps you verify secure and compliant payments.

Enabling the Card Present Connect Platform {#cp-enabling-task}
==============================================================

Before you can use the Card Present Connect platform, you must enable it.  
Follow these steps to enable the Card Present Connect platform:

1. Set up a `Payment Gateway` merchant account. To get started, contact your sales engineer, alliance partner, or technical account manager.
2. Integrate the `Payment Gateway` APIs for use on the Card Present Connect platform.
3. Integrate your terminal's key management encryption and decryption with the Card Present Connect platform.
4. Complete message-level validation (MLV) and Level 3 (L3) device certification. To get started, contact your sales engineer, alliance partner, or technical account manager.

Supported Card Entry Modes {#cp-intro-transactions}
===================================================

Card entry modes describe the ways a payment terminal captures card data during an in-person transaction. These modes depend on how the customer's card interacts with the device and determine how the terminal reads and processes the card information. Understanding these entry modes helps ensure the correct method is used when completing a card-present transaction at a physical retail location.  
Card-present transactions support these entry modes:

EMV (chip-based)
:
The customer inserts the card for a contact payment or taps the card or device for a contactless payment.

Magnetic stripe
:
The customer swipes the card through the magnetic-stripe reader on the device.

Hand-keyed
:
You manually enter the card details when EMV or magnetic-stripe data is unavailable due to card damage, read failure, or other limitations.  
Card-present transactions are typically more secure than card-not-present transactions because both the cardholder and the card are physically present. However, standard risk-control measures still apply. For more information, see [Card-Present Transaction Risk Control Requirements](/docs/gateway/en-us/cp-retail/integration/ctv/rest/cp-retail/cp-intro-cpc/cp-intro-transactions-risk-control.md "").

EMV Card Entry Modes {#cp-intro-about-transactions-emv}
=======================================================

EMV card entry modes describe the ways a payment terminal reads card data from an EMV‑enabled payment card. An EMV card contains an embedded chip that stores cardholder data securely and supports methods that help reduce fraud and improve transaction security.  
The payment terminal uses these card entry modes to obtains EMV card data:

Contact
:
The customer inserts a chip‑enabled card into the payment terminal. You can verify the customer's identity by requiring PIN entry. When signature use cases are added, signature verification might also apply.

Contactless
:
The customer taps a contactless‑enabled card or a payment‑enabled mobile or wearable device on or near the terminal. Supported devices, including cards, phones, watches, and wearables, use the same underlying contactless technology. This type of payment is also called *Tap to Pay*.

Magnetic Stripe Entry Mode {#cp-intro-about-transactions-swipe}
===============================================================

Payment cards typically store customer data on a magnetic stripe embedded in the back of the card. For this entry mode, a customer swipes their card on a payment terminal to pass this data to the merchant's point-of-sale system. Swiping the payment card is typically used for non-EMV cards, such as pre-paid cards, or as an alternative payment method when a contact or contactless EMV payment fails.  
The magnetic stripe entry mode describes how a payment terminal reads card data from the magnetic stripe on the back of a payment card. The terminal captures this data when the customer swipes the card, enabling the point-of-sale system to process the transaction.  
This entry mode is often used for non‑EMV cards, such as prepaid cards, or when EMV contact or contactless interaction cannot be completed due to card or terminal issues.  
Although magnetic‑stripe entry provides a fallback when EMV methods are unavailable, it offers less security because magnetic‑stripe data is easier to copy or compromise. Standard risk‑control measures still apply when using this entry mode. For more information, see [Card-Present Transaction Risk Control Requirements](/docs/gateway/en-us/cp-retail/integration/ctv/rest/cp-retail/cp-intro-cpc/cp-intro-transactions-risk-control.md "").

Hand-Keyed Entry Mode {#cp-intro-about-transactions-keyed}
==========================================================

Hand-keyed entry mode describes how a point-of-sale (POS) system captures card data when the terminal cannot read the card electronically through EMV or magnetic-stripe methods. In this fallback card-data entry mode, you manually type the card details into the POS when the terminal cannot read the card reliably, the card is damaged, or standard entry modes are unavailable.

Card-Present Transaction Risk Control Requirements {#cp-intro-transactions-risk-control}
========================================================================================

Card-present transactions carry lower risk than card-not-present transactions because the customer and payment card are physically present, which can result in lower transaction fees. However, acquirers must still apply standard risk-control measures. Acquirers must monitor transaction activity and manage fraud and disputes in accordance with payment network rules, including the Global Acquirer Risk Standards. They also must comply with these Relay risk compliance programs:

* Relay Fraud Monitoring Program

* Relay Dispute Monitoring Program
  {#cp-intro-transactions-risk-control_ul_gmj_31g_d3c} To meet risk control requirements, acquirers can use one of these options:

* Enable `Payment Gateway` transaction and fraud monitoring tools.

* Ensure that their payment technology partners (PTPs) implement transaction and fraud monitoring tools.

* Deploy their own transaction and fraud monitoring tools.

Each option provides necessary fraud and risk controls for direct merchant relationships and for PTPs that do not operate their own monitoring solutions. For more information, see [Fraud and Risk Management Solutions](https://www.example.com/en-us/solutions/fraud-and-risk-management.md "").

Strong Customer Authentication Support in the EU Region {#cp-auth-sca-intro}
============================================================================

Card Present Connect enables merchants to process card-present transactions in compliance with global payment regulations and mandates. In response to European Union (EU) updates to industry standards, specifically Payment Services Directive version 2 (PSD2) and Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements, `Payment Gateway` now supports SCA transaction processing.  
To comply with PSD2, American Express, Mastercard, and Relay use specific authorization response codes to indicate when SCA is required but was not provided in the initial transaction. This temporary transaction decline is known as a *soft decline*. Card Present Connect supports soft decline response codes for card-present EMV contact and contactless transactions.  
An authorization response that includes a soft decline response code indicates that the transaction cannot be approved until SCA is performed. The payment technology provider's (PTP) point-of-sale (POS) solution must restart the transaction and request information from the customer to complete SCA. The customer typically completes authentication by providing their PIN. How the customer provides SCA information depends on the card type, payment entry mode, and the soft-decline response code received.

Requirements for Strong Customer Authentication Support in the EU Region {#cp-auth-sca-requirements}
====================================================================================================

Your POS system must meet these requirements to ensure PSD2 compliance and support card-present transactions with SCA.

* Supports these POS system capabilities:
  * Contact or contactless EMV transactions
  * Online PIN transactions (where applicable)
  * Repeated transactions with encrypted PIN
* Supports these rest API fields and values to trigger repeated transactions with PIN:
  * pointOfSaleInformation.emv.isRepeat = `true`
  * pointOfSaleInformation.encryptedKeySerialNumber = `&lt;encrypted KSN value&gt;`
  * pointOfSaleInformation.encryptedPin = `&lt;encrypted PIN block&gt;`
  * pointOfSaleInformation.pinBlockEncodingFormat = `encrypted PIN block format`
* Supports these soft-decline authorization response codes:
  * `1A`
  * `65`
  * `70`
    {#cp-auth-sca-requirements_ul_xvh_vc3_b3c}

Supported Soft Decline Authorization Response Codes in the EU Region {#cp-auth-sca-soft-decline-response-codes}

Authorization with Contactless EMV and Online PIN {#cp-emv-contactless-onlinepin-auth-intro}
============================================================================================

For an EMV contactless payment, the customer taps the card on the terminal. The terminal and chip use near-field communication (NFC) to communicate with each other. For an online PIN transaction, the customer uses a PIN to verify their identity and the issuer verifies the PIN.  
Online PIN transactions are supported by these card types:

* Relay
* Mastercard
* American Express
* Discover

Authorization Reversal {#payments-processing-basic-auth-reversal-intro}
=======================================================================

This section provides the information about how to process an authorization reversal.  
Reversing an authorization releases the hold on the customer's payment card funds that the issuing bank placed when processing the authorization.  
For a debit card or prepaid card in which only a partial amount was approved, the amount of the reversal must be the amount that was authorized, not the amount that was requested.
All supported card types can process authorization reversals.

Endpoint {#payments-processing-basic-auth-reversal-intro_d19e85}

Stand-Alone Credit {#cp-services-standalone-credit-intro}
=========================================================

This section describes how to process a stand-alone credit. A stand-alone credit is used to process a credit with no reference to a previous transaction. The amount for a stand-alone credit is not limited because there is no reference to an original transaction amount. The customer is required to present their payment card for this type of credit.

Introduction to PIN Debit Processing {#cp-pd-pin-debit-intro}
=============================================================

Customers commonly use debit cards, also called *ATM cards* or *check cards*, in card-present situations. Your agreement with the debit networks determines whether the customer must provide a personal identification number (PIN).  
`Payment Gateway` supports PIN debit transactions on `Platform Connect`. PIN debit transactions are supported only in the U.S.  
Debit cards are branded with debit network logos, such as STAR, NYCE, Accel, and Pulse, and often with Relay or Mastercard logos. The logos indicate that the cards are accepted wherever Relay or Mastercard are accepted and are processed through a debit or credit card network.
IMPORTANT Issuer regulations require that you present the customer with the choice to use their debit card as a debit or credit card.  
The customer chooses whether to process the card as a debit card or a credit card. In either case, the money is taken out of the customer's bank account, and the transaction is included on the customer's bank account statement. The customer does not receive a credit card bill as they would with a regular credit card.

PIN Debit Integration {#cp-pd-integrating}
==========================================

Follow these steps to integrate PIN debit processing:

1. Contact `Payment Gateway` or your acquirer to determine whether you are eligible to process PIN debit transactions. As part of this process, the debit networks might require you to complete applications.
2. Determine whether `Payment Gateway` or your acquirer requires any additional banking information from you.
3. Determine whether you must comply with any special debit network requirements when processing PIN debit transactions. For example, some networks require that you verify the customer's identity before processing the payment.
4. Contact customer support so that your `Payment Gateway` account can be configured for PIN debit transactions.

PIN Debit Transactions {#pd-processing-flow}
============================================

PIN debit transactions begin when the customer presents a PIN debit card at the payment terminal.

#### Figure:

PIN Debit Transaction Flow  
![Diagram of the PIN Debit transaction flow.](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/card-present/images/pin-debit-infographic.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The customer swipes the card through a magnetic card reader, inserts the card into the EMV terminal (contact), or taps the card against an EMV scanner (contactless) on the terminal.
2. The customer chooses to process the card as a debit card or a credit card. IMPORTANT Issuer regulations require that you present the customer with the choice to use their debit card as a debit or credit card.
3. If the customer chooses the debit card option, you request the PIN debit purchase service. The transaction is routed through the debit card networks.  
   PIN debit transactions are *full-financial transactions*; they are single message transactions that include an authorization and capture. As such, you do not need to request a separate capture as you would with a credit card transaction.  
   If the PIN debit purchase service fails, you can attempt to process the card as a credit card.
4. If the customer chooses the credit card option, or if the card cannot be used for a PIN debit purchase, process the transaction as a credit card sale, requesting the authorization and capture services together. The transaction is routed through the credit card networks.  
   Refer to the *Payments Developer Guide for the REST API \| Platform Connect* for information about using credit card services to process debit card transactions.
5. If you need to refund a PIN debit purchase, use the PIN debit credit service.
6. To reverse a PIN debit purchase or PIN debit credit, use the PIN debit reversal service. IMPORTANT To request a PIN debit reversal, you must submit the request within one hour of the request that you are reversing.

PIN Debit Network Routing {#pd-network-routing-intro}
=====================================================

Listing your preferred network routing codes in your `Business Center` merchant account is an optional setting. To ensure that transactions are routed to networks in your priority order, `Payment Gateway` recommends including the processingInformation.networkRoutingOrder field in PIN debit requests. Set the value to the priority order of the routing networks for the transaction. When you include this field it overrides your merchant account setting. When you do not include this field in your request, `Payment Gateway` uses the list of network codes in your merchant account.  
For Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) transactions, set the processingInformation.networkRoutingOrder field to `K`. If you do not include this field in EBT requests, your merchant account must be configured with `K` in the first priority order for network routing.

PIN Debit Processing Versus Credit Card Processing {#pd-vs-cc-processing}
=========================================================================

You can process Relay or Mastercard branded debit cards through the credit card network by using the credit card authorization and capture services, which is the same way that you process credit card transactions.  
PIN debit transactions and credit card transactions are processed differently from each other:

* For a PIN debit transaction, request only the authorization service. You are not required to request a capture because the authorization service authorizes the transaction and moves the money.
* For a credit card transaction, you receive an authorization code indicating an approval. For a PIN debit transaction, you do not necessarily receive an authorization code. Some processors provide an authorization code, but the code is not required in order for you to receive your money. For a PIN debit transaction, you cannot verbally obtain an authorization code from the processor or bank.

PIN Debit Reconciliation {#pd-recon}
====================================

PIN debit purchase and credit data is added to the TC33A capture file for reconciliation purposes only. Use it to verify this information:

* Merchant ID (MID)
* Total amount
* Approved: yes or no
* Action code

Track Data {#pd-feature-track-data-intro}
=========================================

PIN debit processing uses track 2 data in purchase and credit requests. When you include track data in a request using the pointOfSaleInformation.trackData field, the sentinels are required.  
In this example, the track 2 data follows the semicolon (;). The most important parts of the track data are the card number, card expiration year, and card expiration month. In this example, the card number is 4111111111111111, the expiration year is 26, and the expiration month is 12. The end sentinel (?) follows the final character of data recorded on the track.
Track Data Example

```
;4111111111111111=26121019761186800000?
```

Terminal IDs {#pd-terminal-id}
==============================

By default, your merchant account is configured to validate a default terminal ID (TID). If you want to override the default TID and send TIDs in the pointOfSaleInformation.terminalId request field in PIN Debit requests, contact customer support to configure your account to disable TID validation.

Electronic Benefit Transfer {#pd-feature-ebt-intro}
===================================================

Public assistance programs in the United States use Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) payment cards to issue monthly food and cash benefits to eligible people. EBT cards function like prepaid debit cards that can be used at authorized retailers. Food benefits are issued through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps people with low incomes purchase eligible food items.  
This feature enables you to submit purchase, credit, and reversal requests on EBT cards and vouchers. For EBT transactions, only swiped and manually keyed entry are supported. Contactless EMV transactions are not supported.
IMPORTANT Federal law mandates that you cannot deny an EBT transaction because of technical problems such as a non-working terminal or a non-working PIN pad.  
When a technical problem prevents you from initiating an EBT transaction, follow these steps:

1. Complete an EBT voucher transaction, which is similar to a verbal authorization.
2. Telephone the issuer to receive the approval information verbally.
3. Capture all of the approval information on one of the paper vouchers that you received with the EBT network device.
4. When the EBT system is back online, enter the voucher information into the EBT device to complete the transaction.

PIN Debit Optional Features {#pd-feature-intro}
===============================================

This section describes the optional features that are available for PIN Debit processing.

Cash Back {#pd-feature-cash-back-intro}
=======================================

This feature enables a customer in a card-present situation to add a cash-back amount to the total transaction amount when using a debit card. The customer receives that amount in cash along with the purchase. For example, a customer purchasing products totaling 18.99 might ask for 20.00 cash back. They would pay a total of 38.99 (18.99 + 20.00) with their debit card and receive 20.00 in cash along with their products.
IMPORTANT Cash back is not supported on partial authorizations.  
To use this feature, include the orderInformation.amountDetails.cashbackAmount field in a PIN debit purchase request.  
When the cash-back amount is 0.00, do not include the orderInformation.amountDetails.cashbackAmount field.  
For more information, see [PIN Debit Purchase with Contactless EMV and Cash Back](/docs/gateway/en-us/cp-retail/integration/ctv/rest/cp-retail/pd-processing/pd-cash-back-cntctlss-task.md "").

Merchant Descriptors {#pd-feature-merchdescr-intro}
===================================================

This feature enables you to submit merchant descriptor values that are displayed on a cardholder's statement.
IMPORTANT Before using merchant descriptors in your requests, check with your bank to learn whether you must pre-register your merchant descriptor information with them.  
`Payment Gateway` always provides merchant descriptor information to the acquirer for all of your PIN debit purchase and PIN debit credit transactions. When you do not include a particular merchant descriptor in your PIN debit purchase or PIN debit credit request, `Payment Gateway` uses the corresponding value from your merchant account.  
For more information, see [PIN Debit Purchase with Swiped Track Data and Merchant Descriptors](/docs/gateway/en-us/cp-retail/integration/ctv/rest/cp-retail/pd-processing/pd-purch-swipe-merchdescr-task.md "").

Merchant Descriptor Fields
--------------------------

You can include these merchant descriptor fields in a PIN debit purchase or PIN debit credit:

merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.administrativeArea
:
If you include this field in a request, you must also include merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.country.

merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.alternateName
:

merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.country
:
If you include this field in a request, you must also include merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.administrativeArea.

merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.locality
:

merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.name
:

merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.postalCode
:

Merchant-Inititated Reversals {#pd-feature-mit-reversal-intro}
==============================================================

When you do not receive a response message after sending a PIN debit purchase or credit request, your request might have timed out. This feature enables you to reverse a timed-out transaction within 2 hours of the original request.  
When using the merchant-initiated reversals feature, include the clientReferenceInformation.transactionId field in your original request for a PIN debit purchase. The value of the transaction ID must be unique for 60 days. It links your reversal request to your original request.

Partial Authorizations {#pd-feature-partial-auth-intro}
=======================================================

For PIN debit cards, the issuing bank can approve a partial amount if the balance on the card is less than the requested authorization amount.  
Support for your processor and card type does not guarantee a partial authorization. The issuing bank decides whether or not to approve a partial amount. When the balance on a debit card or prepaid card is less than the requested authorization amount, the issuing bank can approve a partial amount. When this happens, you can accept multiple forms of payment for the order starting with some or all of the approved amount, followed by one or more different payment methods.  
You must opt in to be able to receive and capture partial authorizations. Choose one of these options:

* Call `Payment Gateway` customer support to have your merchant account enabled for partial authorizations. When you do this, all of your authorization requests are enabled for partial authorizations.


* Set the processingInformation.authorizationOptions.partialAuthIndicator field to `true` in a PIN debit purchase request. When you do this, only that specific transaction is enabled for partial authorization.

When your account is enabled for partial authorizations, you can disable partial authorization for a specific transaction by setting the processingInformation.authorizationOptions.partialAuthIndicator field to `false` in the PIN debit purchase request.  
For more information, see [PIN Debit Partial Authorization with Swiped Track Data](/docs/gateway/en-us/cp-retail/integration/ctv/rest/cp-retail/pd-processing/pd-purch-swipe-partial-task.md "").

Payment Network Tokens {#pd-feature-pnt-intro}
==============================================

Payment network tokens are supported as card-present contactless transactions.

Surcharge Fees {#pd-feature-surcharge-intro}
============================================

This feature enables you to charge the customer a surcharge fee for a PIN debit purchase or credit transaction.
IMPORTANT Surcharge fees are not allowed on debit or prepaid cards in the U.S.  
Include the surcharge amount in the total transaction amount, and set the orderInformation.amountDetails.surcharge.amount field to the surcharge amount. This information is passed to the issuer and acquirer for tracking. The issuer can provide information about the surcharge amount to the customer.  
When there is no surcharge fee, do not include the orderInformation.amountDetails.surcharge.amount field in the request.  
For more information, see [PIN Debit Purchase with Contactless EMV and a Surcharge Fee](/docs/gateway/en-us/cp-retail/integration/ctv/rest/cp-retail/pd-processing/pd-cntctlss-purch-srchrg-task.md "").

This section describes how to process PIN debit transactions that use these services:

* Contactless EMV purchases
* Swiped purchases
* Cash back
* Credits
* Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) transactions:
  * EBT cash benefit account purchases
  * EBT Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) account purchases

Mobile Point-of-Sale Payment Services {#cp-services-mpos-intro}
===============================================================

Using software-based, mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) solutions enables you to accept card-present contactless transactions on your mobile device, with or without PIN entry. When processing mPOS transactions, the API request must include mPOS indicators. These indicators enable acquirers and issuers to differentiate between software- and hardware-based mPOS solutions.

Supported Mobile Point-of-Sale Solutions {#cp-services-mpos-supported-trxns}
============================================================================

Card Present Connect supports these mPOS solutions for authorization and sale transactions:

mPOS payments using an embedded reader and software PIN entry
:
This solution is used to process mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) transactions using an embedded reader with software PIN entry. The customer taps a contactless card or payment-enabled smartphone, smart watch, or other wearable device over a contactless-enabled reader and then enters their PIN on the embedded reader to verify their identity.
:
Also known as *Tap To Phone with PIN*.

mPOS using an embedded reader and software with no PIN entry
:
This solution is used to process mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) transactions using an embedded reader and software with no PIN entry. The customer taps a contactless card or payment-enabled smartphone, smart watch, or other wearable device over a contactless-enabled reader. No PIN entry is required because each transaction is accompanied by a unique token (one-time code), similar to contact EMV transactions.
:
Also known as *Tap To Phone with no PIN*.

mPOS payments using an external, contact-only reader with no PIN entry
:
This solution is used to process mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) transactions using an external, contact-only reader with no PIN entry. These are some of the features of this payment method:

    * Dongle or other specialized card-reader hardware
    * EMV chip-compatible
    * No PIN entry required
    This type of transaction is processed using a dongle or other specialized card-reader hardware that is physically connected to your mobile device, which turns it into an mPOS terminal. No PIN entry is required because each transaction is accompanied by a unique token (one-time code), similar to contact EMV transactions. Magnetic stripe transactions are not supported on this type of mPOS terminal.

:
Previously known as *chip-capable mPOS* or *chip-only mPOS*.

mPOS payments using an external reader and hardware PIN entry
:
This solution is used to process mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) transactions using an external reader with hardware PIN entry. These are some of the features of this payment method:

    * Dongle or other specialized card-reader hardware
    * External hardware PIN pad
    * PIN entry required to verify customer identity
    This type of transaction is processed using a dongle or other specialized card-reader hardware that is physically connected to your mobile device, which turns it into an mPOS terminal. Magnetic stripe transactions are not supported on this type of mPOS terminal.

:
Previously known as *hybrid mPOS* or *chip-only mPOS*.

mPOS payments using an external reader and software PIN entry
:
This solution is used to process mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) transactions using an external reader with software PIN entry. These are some of the features of this payment method:

    * Dongle or other specialized card-reader hardware
    * PIN pad on device screen
    * PIN entry required to verify customer identity
    This type of transaction is processed using a dongle or other specialized card-reader hardware that is physically connected to your mobile device, which turns it into an mPOS terminal. Magnetic stripe transactions are not supported on this type of mPOS terminal.

:
Also known as *SPoC*.

`Dynamic Currency Conversion` Payment Services {#dcc-intro}
===========================================================

When processing international transactions, `Dynamic Currency Conversion` (`DCC`) is a service that enables you to convert a transaction amount from a merchant's local currency to the cardholder's billing currency in real time. This service is regulated by Mastercard and Relay.  
The `DCC` service enables you to choose your own currency-conversion service provider for `DCC`. This setup helps you comply with Mastercard and Relay payment processing rules and other regulations for these transaction types.  
The currency conversion is performed directly between you and your `DCC` service provider before authorizing a network-compliant `DCC` transaction on your processor connection.  
These card types support `Dynamic Currency Conversion` transactions:

* Mastercard
* Relay
