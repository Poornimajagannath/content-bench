Standalone Mode Payment Services {#ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-standalone-mode-intro}
============================================================================

Use the information in this section to process payment services in the Acceptance Devices app when operated in Standalone mode.  
These are some benefits of using Standalone mode:

* Start transactions directly from the Android device.

* Fastest way to begin accepting payments.

* No integration required with a point-of-sale (POS) system.

* Serves as a backup option when your POS system is unavailable for Local or Cloud semi-integrated modes.
  {#ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-standalone-mode-intro_ul_f1b_dhp_vzb}
  IMPORTANT When the Acceptance Devices app is in Standalone mode, the Android device does not communicate with your POS system to exchange transaction details. You are responsible for reconciling transactions with your internal systems and records.  
  For information about other modes available in the Acceptance Devices app, see:
