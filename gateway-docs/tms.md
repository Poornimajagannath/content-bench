Introduction to the `Token Management Service` {#tms-overview}
==============================================================

The `Token Management Service` (`TMS`) enables you to replace personally identifiable information (PII), such as the primary account numbers (PANs), with unique tokens. These tokens do not include the PII data, but act as a placeholder for the personal information that would otherwise need to be shared. By using tokens, businesses can provide a secure payment experience, reduce the risk of fraud, and comply with industry consumer security regulations such as PCI-DSS.  
`TMS` links tokens across service providers, payment types, and channels for sellers, acquirers, and technology partners. `TMS` tokenizes, securely stores, and manages the primary account number (PAN), the payment card expiration date, electronic check details, and customer data. `TMS` also enables you to create a network token of a customer's payment card.
IMPORTANT Due to mandates from the Reserve Bank of India, merchants based in India cannot store PANs. Use network tokens instead.  
You can manage sensitive data securely by creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tokens through the [TMS API](https://developer.example.com/api-reference-assets/index.md#token-management "").  
`TMS` simplifies your PCI DSS compliance. `TMS` passes tokens back to you that represent this data. You then store these tokens in your environment and databases instead of storing customer payment details.  
`TMS` protects sensitive payment information through tokenization and secures and manages customer data using these token types:

* Customer tokens
* Instrument identifier tokens
* Payment instrument tokens
* Shipping address tokens

These `TMS` tokens can be used individually, or they can be associated with one customer token:

![TMS token types.](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/tms/images/tms-token-types-vas-925x500.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Instrument Identifier Tokens {#tms-ii-tkn-intro}
================================================

Instrument identifier tokens represent tokenized payment account numbers. Tokenized payment account information includes a primary account number (PAN) for card payments, or a US or Canadian bank account number and routing number for an ACH bank account. An instrument identifier token can exist independently, or it can be associated with a payment instrument.  
An instrument identifier token can also contain an associated network token.  
Instrument identifier tokens are associated with these features:

Card Art
:
`TMS` card art helps your customers select a card. See [Card Art](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-card-art.md "").

Enrollable Network Tokens
:
`TMS` can enroll certain *network tokens* in an instrument identifier token to be used for future payments. Future payments require only the instrument identifier token for the payment information. The types of network tokens you can enroll into an instrument identifier are tokens used for in-app payment methods such as:

    * Android Pay
    * Apple Pay
    * Chase Pay
    * Google Pay
    * Samsung Pay
    * `Relay Click to Pay`

    See [Create an Instrument Identifier for Enrollable Network Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-ii-tkn/tms-manage-ii-tkn/tms-ii-tkn-create-device-tkn-intro.md "").

Push Provisioning
:
Push provisioning connects you with participating issuers to quickly provide credentials to your customers. See [Provision a Network Token with Push Provisioning](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-net-tkn-card-create-intro.md "").

Customer Tokens {#tms-cust-tkn-intro}
=====================================

The customer token contains data about the merchant's customer including email address, customer ID, shipping address (stored in a token), and other related fields.

Shipping Address Tokens {#tms-ship-tkn-intro}
=============================================

The shipping address token contains the shipping address information associated with a customer token. This token includes any shipping address details, including the recipient's first and last name, company, shipping address, email, and phone number. A customer can have one or more shipping addresses, with one allocated as the customer's default shipping address.

Payment Instrument Tokens {#tms-pi-tkn-intro}
=============================================

The payment instrument token contains the complete billing details for the payment type including cardholder name, expiration date, and billing address. These are standalone payment instruments that cannot be associated with a customer.

Network Tokens {#tms-net-tkn}
=============================

When a `TMS` token is used in a transaction, the `TMS` token is de-tokenized, and the PAN is sent to the issuer for authorization. The primary account number (PAN) is still exchanged as the transaction is processed. However, the PAN is removed from transaction processing and replaced with network tokens, making the transaction more secure.  
The network scheme generates network tokens. A token replaces customer card information in order to ensure secure transactions. Network tokens can be mapped to instrument identifier tokens. The minimum card data required in order to request a network token is the PAN and the expiration date.  
Using a network token has benefits:

* Improved authorization rates for credentials-on-file (COF) and recurring payments.
* Real-time card information updates with life-cycle management. See [Network Token Life-Cycle Management](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-onboard/tms-lcm.md "") for more information. When the customer's card details change, you can receive the updated information automatically. See [Manage Webhook Subscriptions](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-onboard/tms-overview-webhook.md "") for more information on managing webhooks.
* Improved customer tracking through the payment account reference (PAR), which is a consumer identifier that is less sensitive than the PAN. The PAR can be exchanged as the transaction is processed.  
  Network tokens can be provided for merchants and partners.  
  IMPORTANT American Express does not support the payment facilitator (PayFac) model for processing network tokens. Contact your American Express representative for more information.

9. The network token provider sends the provisioning response to `TMS`.
10. `TMS` sends you the `TMS` token along with the provisioning status.
11. Using the response sent from `TMS`, you send a request to `TMS` to retrieve the instrument identifier token. See [Retrieve an Instrument Identifier](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-ii-tkn/tms-manage-ii-tkn/tms-ii-tkn-retrieve-intro.md "").
12. `TMS` sends you the instrument identifier token.
13. You store the instrument identifier token for future transactions. Your designation as a merchant or a partner determines how you use an instrument identifier token in an authorization. For more information, see:

Requesting the `Token Management Service` API {#tms-create-request}
===================================================================

Before requesting the `Token Management Service` (`TMS`) API, you must already have a `Business Center` account. If you do not, you can create an evaluation account.  
Follow these steps to request the `TMS` API:

1. Authenticate to the API using either HTTP signature authentication or JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   1. A Base64-encoded shared secret key is passed in the headers you generate for HTTP signature authentication.  
      See [Shared Secret Key Pair](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-http-message-intro/restgs-security-key-pair-intro.md "") in *Getting Started with the REST API* for instructions.
   2. A P12 Certificate is passed in the headers you generate for JWT authentication.  
      See [Create a P12 Certificate](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-jwt-message-intro/restgs-security-p12-intro.md "") in the *Getting Started with the REST API* for instructions.

   {#tms-create-request_ol_2} IMPORTANT

   > These keys are used to authenticate requests that are sent to the ` TMS ` API. You can create REST API keys at the portfolio or transacting organization level.  
   > Portfolio organizations that send requests to the ` TMS ` API on behalf of their transacting merchants can create Meta keys. Meta keys are used to transact on behalf of their multiple transacting MIDs with a single key. For more information on Meta keys, see [Meta Key Creation and Management](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/security-keys/user/all/ada/security-keys/keys-meta-intro.md "") in the *Creating and Using Security Keys* developer guide.

2. Specify one of the following hosts in the URL:

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   1. **Sandbox:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com`
   2. **Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com`
   3. **Production in India:** `POST ``https://api.in.example.com``/`
3. Append the resource, such as, `/tms/v2/customer` to the host URL. For example, `https://api.example.com``/tms/v2/customer`.

4. Pass your request using a `HTTP` `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` method as specified in each API operation.

HTTP Response Headers {#tms-headers}
====================================

| Response Header              | Possible Values   | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
|:-----------------------------|:------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| instrumentidentifier-created | `true` or `false` | This value indicates whether a new instrument identifier was created. For example, you have never tokenized this PAN or bank account, or an existing one was returned. |

Case Sensitivity {#tms-case-sensitivity}
========================================

Token IDs are not case sensitive. The following requests return the same resource:

```
GET /instrumentidentifiers/49C26351BF7D8765E05333B9d30AA9DB
```

```
GET /instrumentidentifiers/49c26351bf7d8765e05333b9d30aa9db
```

IMPORTANT Unlike the token ID in the request URL, all request fields are case sensitive.  
List matching rules:

* Accept any case (web, WEB, WeB).
* Store the expected case (WEB).
* Return the expected case (WEB) metadata.

Metadata {#tms-metadata}
========================

Token type structures such as instrument identifiers and payment instruments contain a metadata map that contains data about the creator.  
A metadata map is returned for every token type in a response to an HTTP POST, GET, and PATCH request.

Example: Metadata from a Response {#tms-metadata_id18AIDJ00DBI}
---------------------------------------------------------------

```
"metadata": {
"creator": "mid1"
}
```

Patching Considerations {#tms-patching}
=======================================

Patching within `TMS` is based on JSON Merge Patch (RFC7396), in which changes follow the same structure being modified as that of a POST request, rather than JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Patch (RFC6902), in which changes are expressed as a set of actions.  
A PATCH request is different from a PUT request in that only the fields that must be changed need to be provided in the request, and those changes are merged with the existing record.  
Here are some rules to consider:

* When a field is to be removed, you can remove a field by entering a value of `null`.
* When a field is set to `null`, and it does not exist in the current record, it is ignored.
* You can remove groups of fields by setting the parent container to `null`.

> IMPORTANT Array values are patched as a whole, so in the patch request, provide the final value that is expected after the patch.

Patching Examples {#tms-patching_id18AIE030JZJ}
-----------------------------------------------

Below are some use-case examples of patching rules.  
**Example: Updating Expiration Month and Year Values**  
You can get the existing values by sending a GET request to the payment instrument ID as shown below:

```
GET /tms/v1/paymentinstrument/&lt;id&gt;
```

The response is shown below:

```keyword
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.example.com/tms/v1/paymentinstruments/9000000000000000002001"
     }
  },
  "id": "9000000000000000002001",
  "object": "paymentInstrument",
  "state": "ACTIVE",
  "card": {
    "expirationMonth": "09",
    "expirationYear": "2017",
    "type": "relay",
    "issueNumber": "01"
  },
  "_embedded": {
    "instrumentIdentifier": {
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.example.com/tms/v1/instrumentidentifiers/9000000000000000001001"
        }
      },
      "id": "9000000000000000001001",
      "object": "instrumentIdentifier",
      "state": "ACTIVE",
      "card": {
        "number": "411111XXXX11112"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To update just the **card.expirationMonth** and **card.expirationYear** fields, send the following PATCH request:

```
PATCH /tms/v1/paymentinstrument/&lt;id&gt;
{
  "card": {
    "expirationMonth": "10",
    "expirationYear": "2020"
  }
}
```

You can see the new values by issuing another GET request to `/tms/v1/paymentinstrument/&lt;id&gt;`. The response is shown below.

```keyword
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.example.com/tms/v1/paymentinstruments/9000000000000000002001"
    }
  },
  "id": "9000000000000000002001",
  "object": "paymentInstrument",
  "state": "ACTIVE",
  "card": {
    "expirationMonth": "10",
    "expirationYear": "2020",
    "type": "relay",
    "issueNumber": "01"
  },  "_embedded": {
    "instrumentIdentifier": {
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.example.com/tms/v1/instrumentidentifiers/9000000000000000001001"
        }
      },
      "id": "9000000000000000001001",
      "object": "instrumentIdentifier",
      "state": "ACTIVE",
      "card": {
        "number": "411111XXXX11112"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example: Removing Card Issue Number (Single Field) and Buyer Information (Container)**  
First, send a GET request to `/tms/v1/paymentinstrument/&lt;id&gt;` to see the current values:

```keyword
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.example.com/tms/v1/paymentinstruments/9000000000000000002001"
    }
  },
  "id": "9000000000000000002001",
  "object": "paymentInstrument",
  "state": "ACTIVE",
  "card": {
    "expirationMonth": "09",
    "expirationYear": "2017",
    "type": "relay",
    "issueNumber": "01"
  },
  "buyerInformation": {
    "companyTaxID": "12345",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "_embedded": {
    "instrumentIdentifier": {
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.example.com/tms/v1/instrumentidentifiers/9000000000000000001001"
        }
      },
      "id": "9000000000000000001001",
      "object": "instrumentIdentifier",
      "state": "ACTIVE",
      "card": {
        "number": "411111XXXX11112"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then send a PATCH request to `/tms/v1/paymentinstrument/&lt;id&gt;` and include the following payload:

```
{
  "card": {
    "issueNumber": null
  },
"buyerInformation": null
}
```

The result can be seen in the next GET request to `/tms/v1/paymentinstrument/&lt;id&gt;`:

```keyword
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.example.com/tms/v1/paymentinstruments/9000000000000000002001"
    }
  },
  "id": "9000000000000000002001",
  "object": "paymentInstrument",
  "state": "ACTIVE",
  "card": {
    "expirationMonth": "09",
    "expirationYear": "2017",
    "type": "relay"
  }
  "_embedded": {
    "instrumentIdentifier": {
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.example.com/tms/v1/instrumentidentifiers/9000000000000000001001"
        }
      },
      "id": "9000000000000000001001",
      "object": "instrumentIdentifier",
      "state": "ACTIVE",
      "card": {
        "number": "411111XXXX11112"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example: Patching an Array**  
Original value:

```
{
  "a": [
    {
      "b": "c",
      "d": "e"
    }
  ]
}
```

Patch payload:

```
{
  "a": [
    {
      "z": "y"
    }
  ]
}
```

Final value:

```
{
  "a": [
      {
      "z": "y"
    }
  ]
}
```

Pagination {#tms-pagination}
============================

Responses can indicate pagination if you include the **limit** and **offset** fields in your request.

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `limit`   | Controls the maximum number of items that can be returned for a single request. The default is 20; the maximum is 100. If you set a limit greater than 100, the following error results: ``` Http Status: 400 Bad Request Body { "errors": [ { "type": "invalidParameters", "message": "Invalid parameter values", "details": [ { "name": "limit" } ] } ] } ```                                                                                                                                |
| `offset`  | Controls the starting point within the collection of results. Defaults to `0`. Setting a zero offset retrieves the first item in the collection. For example, if you have a collection of 15 items to be retrieved from a resource, and you specify `limit=5` , you can retrieve the entire set of results in three successive requests by varying the offset value: `offset=0`, `offset=5`, and `offset=10`. An offset greater than the number of results does not return an embedded object. |

Pagination Response Header {#tms-pagination_id18AIF000WL7}
----------------------------------------------------------

Examples {#tms-pagination_id18AIF0030NW}
----------------------------------------

**Pagination Example 1**  
This example shows a request for objects 41 to 60.  
**Request**

```keyword
GET https://api.example.com/tms/v1/instrumentidentifiers/5BAAD18F8091052CE0539399D30AAB2F/paymentinstruments?offset=40&limit=20
```

For merchants in India, the Production endpoint is `https://api.in.example.com/`

> IMPORTANT
>
> * If you are on the first collection, the previous link would not be included.
> * If you are on the last collection, the next link would not be included.

* All other links are always included. For example, if there was only one collection of results, the URL for ` self `, ` first `, and ` last ` links would be the same.  
  **Response**

```

**Pagination Example 2 - Offset to Limit Relationship**  
This example shows a request for objects 3 to 6, from a total of 8 objects.  
The example below shows the second collection of results and highlights that the previous page link will not change the user's original limit parameter value.  
This means that the previous collection will contain objects 0-3, and therefore collection 1 and collection 2 will both contain object 3.  
**Request**

```keyword
GET https://api.example.com/tms/v1/instrumentidentifiers/5BAAD18F8091052CE0539399D30AAB2F/paymentinstruments?offset=3&limit=4
```

`Token Management Service` Onboarding {#tms-onboarding}
=======================================================

This section contains information necessary to onboard merchants and `TMS` vault management:

* [Merchant ID Hierarchy](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-mid-hierarchy.md "")
* [Merchant ID Registration](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-mid-reg.md "")
* [Portfolio MIDs for Partners](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-mid-partner.md "")
* [Token Vault Management](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-vault-hierarchy.md "")
* [Token Management Message-Level Encryption Keys](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-mle-setup.md "")

Merchant ID Hierarchy {#tms-mid-hierarchy}
==========================================

The `Business Center` is an online portal provisioned to partners and end merchants. This portal can be used to onboard merchants, view transactional activity and generate and download reports among other things.  
There are two environments associated with the `Business Center`. Each has its own corresponding URL in order to gain access to the `Business Center` for the relevant environment:  
**Test** : `https://businesscentertest.example.com`  
**Production** : `https://businesscenter.example.com`  
In order to gain access to `Business Center` partners/merchants must be provisioned with an Organization ID, otherwise known as a merchant ID (MID). There are multiple types of MIDs:

* **Portfolio**: This is typically a MID that is provisioned to partners. Portfolio MIDs enable partners to onboard merchants into either a test or production environment.
* **Merchant** : This is a parent MID that can house multiple transactional MIDs. This will be directly associated with the end merchant and will be created by the partner under the portfolio MID. This MID will be attached to specific functionality such as the token vault (`Token Management Service` vault).
* **Transactional** : This is a child MID. Each partner's end merchant may have multiple transactional MIDs. The transactional MID is typically used for processing into `Token Management Service`, for example, to provision a network token via the `Token Management Service` API. This will be directly associated with the partners end merchant and will be created by the partner under the portfolio MID.
  {#tms-mid-hierarchy_ul_bts_hfj_rwb}

Merchant ID Registration {#tms-mid-reg}
=======================================

A `Payment Gateway` MID is a unique value within `Payment Gateway` that you define during account registration. Your MID identifies your merchant account and payment configuration within `Payment Gateway` systems. You provide this identifier when you sign in to the `Business Center` and submit transactions to `Payment Gateway`.  
Multiple MIDs can be configured for various token types. You receive the instrument identifier token regardless of your account's token type. Reasons for multiple MIDs include:

* You have multiple processors.
* Point-of-sale terminals have unique MIDs, which are usually configured for the PAN-only instrument identifier token.
  {#tms-mid-reg_ul_vhc_rc5_qwb}  
  When you have multiple MIDs, you can set up one token vault to which all of your MIDs have access or set up multiple vaults to limit access to tokens. See [Token Vault Management](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-vault-hierarchy.md "") for more information on setting up and managing your token vault.

Create an Evaluation Account
----------------------------

To create an evaluation account, visit the [`Business Center` Evaluation Account Sign-Up](https://developer.example.com/hello-world/sandbox.md "")  
To complete the registration process, follow the email instructions that you received to activate your merchant account, and log in to the `Business Center`.  
Send your merchantID to `TMS` representative supporting you with integration to create a vault and enable `Token Management Service` with network tokens.

Portfolio MIDs for Partners {#tms-mid-partner}
==============================================

Partners will need to onboard merchants using a portfolio MID. To create a portfolio MID, contact `Payment Gateway` support. For information about creating a portfolio MID, visit the Support Center:  
<http://support.example.com>  
Customer support will respond with a questionnaire. The below information will need to be completed:

* **Organization ID**: Portfolio MID name
* **Environment**: Test and Production
* **Business information**: The business name and address

Token Vault Management {#tms-vault-hierarchy}
=============================================

Token vaults are where merchants store their customer and payment data. A `Business Center` internal user can enable the `TMS` vault.  
Vaults are assigned to an owner, and all data within the vault belongs to the owner. You can grant permission to individual MIDs to create, retrieve, update, and delete tokens within a vault. Created tokens belong to the owner of the vault, not the creator of the token. If you remove a MID from a vault, it can no longer access any tokens within that vault, including tokens created under that MID.
IMPORTANT It is not currently possible to merge vaults, so ensure that merchants are set up with the correct vault by creating a new vault or granting access to an existing vault.

Token Management Message-Level Encryption Keys {#tms-mle-setup}
===============================================================

You must use *token management message-level encryption (MLE) keys* in order for personally identifiable information, such as payment information, to be returned unmasked by TMS. You must create an MLE security key for your `Payment Gateway` merchant account in the `Business Center` before a TMS response can return unmasked payment information using MLE.  
MLE keys can be created at the portfolio and transacting levels of an organization. You must create an MLE key at the portfolio level of an organization if you want to use a single MLE key for the encryption and decryption of payment information for multiple merchants. To do so, you must log in to the `Business Center` using your portfolio credentials and ensure that the MLE key is generated for your organization.  
MLE keys expire after 3 years.  
Security keys can be used to make any request, including payments. Treat your security keys as you would any secure password.  
You must use separate keys for the test and production environments.

Prerequisite
------------

You must have a tool such as OpenSSL installed on your system.  
To create an MLE key, you must first extract a public key. You can use a tool such as OpenSSL to extract the key:

```
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048 && openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

For information creating an MLE key, see [Creating a Token Management MLE Key](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-mle-setup/keys-mle-create.md "").

Creating a Token Management MLE Key {#keys-mle-create}
======================================================

Network Tokenization Overview {#tms-net-tkn-onboard}
====================================================

Network tokenization replaces a customer's primary account number (PAN) with a network token. A network token is a tokenized card number that is issued by card networks (for example, Relay, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover). Network tokens use the same format as a PAN but are domain-restricted and cryptographically secured. This reduces exposure to fraud and data breaches.  
Unlike standard tokens that are converted back to the PAN during authorization, network tokens remove the PAN from the payment flow. Each network token is provisioned with its own expiration date and is paired with a dynamic cryptogram. Tokens can be restricted to a specific merchant, device, or transaction context.  
Initially introduced for digital wallets, network tokens now support card-on-file (COF) use cases such as subscriptions, recurring payments, and one-click checkout, enabling secure storage and reuse of payment credentials.  
`Token Management Service` (`TMS`) tokens can be linked to network tokens:

* Instrument identifier tokens represent the underlying account
* Payment instrument tokens represent a stored payment method
* Customer tokens represent a stored customer profile

{#tms-net-tkn-onboard_ul_dwq_54k_mjc}

Key Benefits and Features {#tms-net-tkn-onboard_section_ecn_4qk_mjc}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Network tokenization helps improve payment security, performance, and customer experience:

* **Enhanced security**: Tokens are domain-restricted and tied to your Token Requestor ID (TRID), so they can only be used in your environment. Tokens cannot be reused outside that domain and can be deactivated without reissuing cards.
* **Higher authorization rates**: Each transaction includes a dynamic cryptogram. This provides additional assurance to issuers and helping improve authorization performance.
* **Automatic updates**: Card life-cycle changes, such as reissues or expirations, are updated automatically. You receive updates without handling new card numbers, reducing payment disruptions.
* **Reduced PCI scope**: By storing tokens instead of raw card data, you can lower PCI compliance requirements and the associated costs.
* **Simplified checkout**: Cardholders can complete transactions without re-entering CVV, reducing friction and improving conversion.
* **Enhanced checkout experiences**: Support for card art and push provisioning enables seamless onboarding and enhanced checkout or wallet interactions.
  {#tms-net-tkn-onboard_ul_j5w_4qk_mjc}

Integration Models {#tms-net-tkn-onboard_section_ypk_crk_mjc}
-------------------------------------------------------------

You can tokenize payment credentials using `TMS` or when you process payments:

* **`TMS` tokenization** : Use `TMS` as a standalone service for token provisioning, cryptogram generation, and lifecycle updates.
* **Tokenization with payments** : Extend existing payment flows with minimal changes, while `TMS` manages token life-cycle and transaction handling.
  {#tms-net-tkn-onboard_ul_ms5_2rk_mjc}

Network Token Enablement {#tms-net-tkn-enablement}
==================================================

Merchants {#tms-net-tkn-enablement_section_axk_rrk_mjc}
-------------------------------------------------------

Network token enablement is currently a manual process and requires a request to be sent to `Payment Gateway` support. For more information about network token enablement, visit the Support Center:  
<http://support.example.com>

> IMPORTANT
> Before sending the request, you must ensure that the merchant/parent MID has been created and the ` TMS ` product is enabled.

Partners {#tms-net-tkn-enablement_section_mjd_srk_mjc}
------------------------------------------------------

Partners can use a portfolio on `our platform` to board merchants and enable them for `TMS`.  
Portfolios can onboard merchants using the `Business Center` or through an API integration to onboard merchants.  
For information about merchant boarding using the `Business Center`, see *Create Organizations* in the [Merchant Boarding User Guide](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/user/all/ebc/boarding-user/boarding-reg-intro.md "").  
For information about merchant boarding using the API, see *Enable TMS and Enroll in Network Tokenization for a New Merchant* in the [Merchant Boarding Developer Guide](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/boarding/developer/all/rest/boarding/boarding-products-intro/boarding-tms/boarding-tms-enable-net-tkn-intro.md "").

Network Token Onboarding---Partner Model {#tms-workflow-net-tkn-onboard-aggregator}
===================================================================================

This workflow shows the merchant onboarding process.  
The workflow begins when the partner creates a merchant profile on the `Payment Gateway` platform using `TMS` templates.

#### Figure:

Network Token Onboarding for Partners ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/tms/images/net-tkn-partner-onboard-600x610.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)
1. The gateway sets up templates for TMS.
2. partner creates merchant profile using TMS templates.
3. The partner submits a request to `Payment Gateway` via API.
4. `Payment Gateway` creates a merchant based on the API request and confirms boarding success with partner.
5. The partner provides merchant details via email to enable network tokenization and submits email to `Payment Gateway` support.
6. `Payment Gateway` verifies the request, generates the onboarding request, and sends the request to the card brand.
7. The card brand completes the registration process and responds to `Payment Gateway` with the confirmation and token requestor ID (TRID).
8. `Payment Gateway` notifies the partner that onboarding is complete.
9. The partner completes merchant setup.

Network Token Life-Cycle Management {#tms-lcm}
==============================================

Life-cycle management is a key feature of credentials-on-file (COF) network tokenization. Issuers can keep COF network tokens updated as changes are made to their cardholders' accounts.  
`TMS` notifies you in real time when updates are made to a card represented by the COF network token in your `TMS` vault. Issuers push the life-cycle management updates either in real time or via a batch process to the card brands. Life-cycle updates and timelines will vary by issuer based on their update process. For example, `TMS` notifies you when a card becomes inactive.  
`TMS` and webhooks enable you to stay informed about the status of COF network tokens in different ways:

* Subscribe to real time notifications for lifecycle management events using Webhooks. For information about webhooks subscription, see [Manage Webhook Subscriptions](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-onboard/tms-overview-webhook.md "").
* Generate reports that contain life-cycle management events for network tokens. For information about network token life-cycle management, see [Network Token Life-Cycle Management Reports](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-onboard/net-tkn-lcm.md "").
* Simulate life-cycle management for Relay cards using the simulator. For information about simulating life-cycle events, see [Simulate Life-Cycle Management Events](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-net-tkn-lcm-simulate-intro.md "").  
  When a network token is provisioned, these life-cycle management reasons can be applied:

|         Reason         |                                                Description                                                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PROVISIONED`          | A network token has been provisioned.                                                                     |
| `CARD_UPDATED`         | The card expiration date or last four digits have been updated.                                           |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRY_UPDATED` | The token expiration date has been updated.                                                               |
| `TOKEN_UPDATED`        | The token expiration date and token status have been updated.                                             |
| `METADATA_UPDATED`     | The card metadata such as card art or issuer data has been updated.                                       |
| `REDIGITALIZATION`     | A new network token has been created due to redigitization. This status is available only for Mastercard. |
| `TOKEN_STATUS_UPDATED` | The status of the network token has been updated.                                                         |
[Life-Cycle Management Reasons and Descriptions]

When you receive the `TOKEN_STATUS_UPDATED` life-cycle management update reason, one of these network token statuses is applied:

|   Status    |                                                                                                 Description                                                                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACTIVE`    | The account and network token are active and in good standing. When COF network tokens are active, merchants can process transactions according to their COF agreement.                                      |
| `SUSPENDED` | This status is temporary for COF network tokens and can change to `ACTIVE` or `DELETED`. Merchants should not send authorizations on suspended tokens. These tokens can be re-activated by the issuer later. |
| `DELETED`   | This is the final state for a network token. A network token can be deleted when the account is closed or on cardholder instruction.                                                                         |
[`TOKEN_STATUS_UPDATED` Statuses and Descriptions]

> IMPORTANT  
> When a network token passes its expiration date and no life-cycle management update has occurred, the network token status will change to ` EXPIRED `. This is not a status that results from a life-cycle management update.  
> ` Payment Gateway ` does not process transactions with network tokens that have an ` EXPIRED ` status and merchants should not send transactions with network tokens that have an ` EXPIRED ` status. When the network token status is ` EXPIRED `, there should be a life-cycle management notification from the issuer to update the expiration date of the token, or the merchant can submit another provision request.

Network Token Life-Cycle Management Reports {#net-tkn-lcm}
==========================================================

You can generate reports that contain Life-Cycle Management events for Network Tokens. These reports include network token-related fields that are updated as a result of the Life-Cycle Management events sent to the `Token Management Service`.

Token Requestor IDs {#tms-trids}
================================

A token requestor ID (TRID) is a unique identifier that entities such as merchants use to request network tokens from token providers. Having a TRID is a prerequisite for enabling network tokenization.  
Each entity must register with the token provider to get a TRID. Contact a `Payment Gateway` representative to enroll a merchant as a token requestor.

Relay and Mastercard TRIDs
-------------------------

An internal user can enroll a merchant as a CARD or Mastercard token requestor through the `Business Center`.  
Follow these steps to enroll a merchant as a token requestor in the `Business Center`:
1. Log in to the test environment or production environment.

   * **Test** : `https://businesscentertest.example.com`
   * **Production** : `https://businesscenter.example.com`
2. Navigate to Token Management.

3. Click Vault Management.

4. Use the Vault Owner filter to search for the merchant account that has `TMS` enabled.

5. Choose the merchant account to view the `TMS` vaults that are configured for the merchant.

6. Click Network Tokenization.

7. Click Enroll to CARD/Mastercard token services.

8. Enter the required information for each card type:

   Mastercard
   :
   Business entity name

   Relay
   :
   Merchant name
   :
   Merchant website URL
   :
   Merchant country code

9. Click Onboard with Acquirer ID.

10. Enter the required information:

    Acquirer ID
    :
    Set the value to `40010052242`. It is a static acquirer ID that is used for `TMS`.

    Acquirer Merchant ID
    :
    Enter your organization ID.

11. Click Enroll to Network Token Services to complete enrollment.
    When the enrollment is submitted, the relationship ID and token requestor ID appear on the page for Relay Token Service (VTS) and the token requestor ID appears for Mastercard.  
    In order to request a TRID from the token provider, `Payment Gateway` uses merchant business details already stored. If any of the details are not present, a dialog form should appear prompting you to complete the missing information.

American Express TRIDs
----------------------

Enrollment as a token requestor for American Express is a manual process. Contact your `Payment Gateway` representative to request the TRID for American Express.  
Allow 2 to 3 days for the completion of your request.

> IMPORTANT
> **Service establishment (SE) Numbers** are required in order to process American Express card transactions.

Digital Commerce Authentication Program {#tms-dcap}
===================================================

![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/tms/images/tms-dcap-650x150.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
The Digital Commerce Authentication Program (DCAP), provides you with a way to enhance the security and reliability of card-not-present transactions by providing enhanced data without adding complexity in checkout. DCAP helps the clients that use network tokenization to provide more information to issuers when purchases are made using network tokens.  
DCAP does not require the token to be an authenticated payment credential. Instead, you can include additional fields in the transaction request that are sent to the issuer and are used in risk scoring. This enables issuers to make a more informed authorization decision.  
For information about creating payment credentials for DCAP, see [Generate Payment Credentials for Digital Commerce Authentication Program](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-net-tkn-pay-cred-dcap-intro.md "").

Manage Network Tokens {#tms_net_tkn_intro}
==========================================

This section contains information about how to manage network tokens using `TMS`.  
You can manage network tokens using the Instrument Identifiers, Tokenized Cards, and Payment Credentials APIs.

Tokenized Cards API {#tms_net_tkn_intro_section_idv_fwf_3jc}
------------------------------------------------------------

The Tokenized Cards API enables you to create, retrieve, and manage network tokens:

* [Create a Network Token](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-net-tkn-partner-card-intro.md "")

* [Retrieve a Network Token](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-net-tkn-card-retrieve-tkn-consumer-intro.md "")

* [Delete a Network Token](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-net-tkn-card-delete-tkn-consumer-intro.md "")
  {#tms_net_tkn_intro_ul_jtr_ffy_hjc}  
  The Tokenized Cards API also supports these value-added capabilities for network tokenization:

* [Provision a Network Token for a Consumer](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-net-tkn-card-create-cof-intro.md "")

* [Provision a Network Token with Push Provisioning](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-net-tkn-card-create-intro.md "")

* [Payment Passkey](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-passkey-intro.md "")
  {#tms_net_tkn_intro_ul_utp_kfy_hjc}  
  For information about network tokenization, see [Network Tokenization Overview](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-onboard.md "").  
  To retrieve payment credentials, including a cryptogram for a network token, see [Generate Payment Credentials](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-net-tkn-pay-cred-intro.md "").  
  Use this endpoint to access the Tokenized Cards API: `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/tms/v2/tokenized-cards`

Payment Credentials API {#tms_net_tkn_intro_section_t22_gwf_3jc}
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Payment Credentials API enables you to generate and retrieve network token payment credentials such as:

* Network token value

* Cryptogram (Relay and Mastercard only)

* Dynamic card verification value (CVV) (American Express only)
  {#tms_net_tkn_intro_ul_s5x_txf_3jc}  
  Use this endpoint to access the Payment Credentials API: `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/tms/v2/tokens/`*{tokenId}/*`payment-credentials`  
  You can also provision a network token while creating an instrument identifier token or when you process a payment:

* `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/tms/v1/instrumentidentifiers`

* `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/pts/v2/payments`
  {#tms_net_tkn_intro_ul_t1k_342_mjc}  
  For information about provisioning a network token when you create an instrument identifier, see *Create Instrument Identifier Using Card and Create Network Token* in the [`Payment Gateway` Developer Center API Reference](https://developer.example.com/api-reference-assets/index.md#token-management_instrument-identifier_create-an-instrument-identifier_samplerequests-dropdown_create-instrument-identifier-using-card-and-create-network-token_liveconsole-tab-request-body "").  
  For information about provisioning a network token when you process a payment, see *Authorization with a Customer Token* in the [`Payment Gateway` Developer Center API Reference](https://developer.example.com/api-reference-assets/index.md#payments_payments_process-a-payment_samplerequests-dropdown_authorization-with-token-create_authorization-with-customer-token-creation_liveconsole-tab-request-body "").

Provision a Network Token for a Card Number {#tms-net-tkn-partner-card-intro}
=============================================================================

This section describes how to provision a network token for a card number.  
Network tokens that are provisioned by `TMS` are card-on-file (COF) tokens.

> IMPORTANT  
> When provisioning a network token, you must include the *"Accept:application/jose"* request header to receive the unmasked network token value for successful provisions in the API response.  
> When included, the response body contents will be encrypted using the organizations Token Management Message Level Encryption Key (MLE) in the Business Center. For more information, see [Token Management Message-Level Encryption Keys](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-mle-setup.md "").  
> You can use specific test card numbers to provision network tokens in the sandbox environment, see [Test Card Numbers](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-create-request/tms-test-cards.md "").  
> For information on network token provision failures, see [Network Token Provision Failures](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-net-tkn-fail-ex-rest.md "").

Generate Payment Credentials for Digital Commerce Authentication Program {#tms-net-tkn-pay-cred-dcap-intro}
===========================================================================================================

This section describes how to create payment credentials with data for the Digital Commerce Authentication Program (DCAP). ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/tms/images/tms-dcap-650x150.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
The Digital Commerce Authentication Program (DCAP), provides you with a way to enhance the security and reliability of card-not-present transactions by providing enhanced data without adding complexity in checkout. DCAP helps the clients that use network tokenization to provide more information to issuers when purchases are made using network tokens.  
DCAP does not require the token to be an authenticated payment credential. Instead, you can include additional fields in the transaction request that are sent to the issuer and are used in risk scoring. This enables issuers to make a more informed authorization decision. You can use the payment credentials API to retrieve the payment credentials for an existing customer, payment instrument, instrument identifier or tokenized card. For information about these token types, see these topics:

* [Customer Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-cust-tkn.md "")
* [Payment Instrument Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-pi-tkn.md "")

Provision a Network Token for a Consumer {#tms-net-tkn-card-create-cof-intro}
=============================================================================

When you provision a network token for an individual consumer in a wallet, you can manage the network token and payment credentials separately for that consumer. Provisioning network tokens for a consumer is supported for American Express, Mastercard, and Relay. This section describes how to provision a network token for a card number and a consumer ID.  
Network tokens that are provisioned by `TMS` are card-on-file (COF) tokens.

> IMPORTANT
> You must be enabled as an ECOM enabler in the Relay Token Service (VTS) to provision a network token with a consumer ID. For more information, contact your ` Payment Gateway ` account representative.

Provision a Network Token with Push Provisioning {#tms-net-tkn-card-create-intro}
=================================================================================

This section describes how to provision a network token with push provisioning.
IMPORTANT This feature is in pilot phase. You have early access to this feature even though it might contain bugs or unfinished work. Please consider the risk when using this feature.  
Push provisioning connects you with participating banks to enable the secure transfer of customer and payment information that is stored by banks. Using push provisioning, the issuer can provide credentials straight to your customer in seconds.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before using the push provisioning service, you must meet these requirements:

* You must be configured for `TMS`. See [Token Management Service Onboarding](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding.md "").
* Network tokens must be enabled. For more information, see [Network Token Enablement](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-onboard/tms-net-tkn-enablement.md "").
* Push provisioning must be enabled with the card brand.
* The issuer must be integrated with the card brand.

Create Tokens {#tms-tokenize-intro}
===================================

This section describes how to create tokens using `TMS`.  
The `tokenize` API enables you to create multiple `TMS` token types such as instrument identifiers, payment instruments, and customer tokens. You can create these tokens individually or all together in a single request.  
You can create these `TMS` tokens in a single request:

* Customer token
* Payment instrument
* Shipping address token
* Instrument identifier  
  For information about the token types that are available with `TMS`, see [Introduction to the Token Management Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-overview.md "").  
  You can also create these tokens using the information that is retrieved from a transient token. For information on transient tokens, see the `Microform Integration` and `Unified Checkout` developer guides.

> IMPORTANT
> The ` tokenize ` API requires message-level encryption (MLE). You must encrypt the payload using an encrypted JWT to send requests. For information about enabling MLE, see *How to Set up REST* in the [Getting Started with REST Developer Guide](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-setup-workflow.md "") and follow the steps based on your integration method.  
> A successful response to a request returns status and identifiers for each token.

Instrument Identifier Tokens {#tms-ii-tkn}
==========================================

Instrument identifier tokens represent tokenized payment account numbers. Tokenized payment account information includes a primary account number (PAN) for card payments, or a US or Canadian bank account number and routing number for an ACH bank account. An instrument identifier token can exist independently, or it can be associated with a payment instrument.  
An instrument identifier token can also contain an associated network token.  
Instrument identifier tokens are associated with these features:

Card Art
:
`TMS` card art helps your customers select a card. See [Card Art](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-card-art.md "").

Enrollable Network Tokens
:
`TMS` can enroll certain *network tokens* in an instrument identifier token to be used for future payments. Future payments require only the instrument identifier token for the payment information. The types of network tokens you can enroll into an instrument identifier are tokens used for in-app payment methods such as:

    * Android Pay
    * Apple Pay
    * Chase Pay
    * Google Pay
    * Samsung Pay
    * `Relay Click to Pay`

    See [Create an Instrument Identifier for Enrollable Network Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-ii-tkn/tms-manage-ii-tkn/tms-ii-tkn-create-device-tkn-intro.md "").

Push Provisioning
:
Push provisioning connects you with participating issuers to quickly provide credentials to your customers. See [Provision a Network Token with Push Provisioning](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-intro/tms-net-tkn-card-create-intro.md "").

Manage Instrument Identifier Tokens {#tms-manage-ii-tkn}
========================================================

This section contains information on managing instrument identifier tokens.  
The instrument identifier token type represents the tokenized Primary Account Number (PAN) for card payments, or US or Canadian bank account number and routing number. An instrument identifier can contain a credit card, ACH bank account, or tokenized card such as Apple Pay or Android Pay. You can create, retrieve, update, or delete an instrument identifier by submitting an HTTP `POST`, `GET`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` operation to the `/tms/v1/instrumentidentifiers` endpoint.  
Use the `TMS` REST API instrument identifier endpoint to:
* [Create an instrument identifier token](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-ii-tkn/tms-manage-ii-tkn/tms-ii-tkn-create-intro.md "")

Response to a Successful Request
--------------------------------

A successful response includes the instrument identifier in the id field and the `TOKEN` indicator in the tokenizedCard.source field. The `TOKEN` indicator denotes that the instrument identifier was created from a device token. A payment account reference (PAR) number is also returned in the issuer.paymentAccountReference field.  
`Payment Gateway` returns a reason code in the details.reason response field to indicate the reason for an API request's status. For more information about all possible reason codes, see the [*`Payment Gateway` Reason Codes with REST API response*](https://support.example.com/knowledgebase/knowledgearticle/?code=KA-04103 "") article.

Merchant-Initiated Transactions
-------------------------------

You can create an instrument identifier that stores a device token while you are requesting an authorization. Such requests are typically performed for follow-on merchant-initiated transactions. For more information about how to create an instrument identifier within an authorization request, see these sections in the *Payments Developer Guide* :

* [Installment Payments](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/credentials-processsing-intro/credentials-install-intro.md "")

Retrieve an Instrument Identifier with an Unmasked Card Number {#tms-ii-retrieve-unmasked-card-intro}
=====================================================================================================

This section describes how retrieve an instrument identifier with an unmasked card number.

> IMPORTANT
> To retrieve unmasked payment details, you must ensure that your MLE key pair and your token vault are configured correctly. For more information on MLE keys, see [Token Management Message-Level Encryption Keys](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-mle-setup.md ""). For more information on token vaults, see [Token Vault Management](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-vault-hierarchy.md ""). If necessary, contact your ` Payment Gateway ` account manager or customer support.  
> The response is BASE 64-encoded JSON web encryption (JWE) token. The decoded JWE has these elements:

```
{ "alg": "RSA-OAEP-256", //The algorithm used to encrypt the CEK 
    "cty": "json", //The content type 
    "typ": "JWT", //The token type 
    "enc": "A256GCM", //The algorithm that is used to encrypt the message 
    "kid": "keyId" //The serial number of shared public cert for encryption of CEK
} 
&lt;Encrypted Data&gt; //The encrypted payload that matches the JSON response normally returned by the TMS API, except with an unmasked payment details
```

Header Configuration {#tms-ii-retrieve-unmasked-card-intro_tms-ii-retrieve-unmasked-card-header}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must pass this request header to retrieve unmasked payment details: `Accept: application/jose`.  
The term `application/jose` refers to Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE). JOSE is a framework that provides end-to-end security to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-based data structures. JOSE achieves this by offering a collection of specifications to encrypt and digitally sign JSON payloads. In this case, the response is message-level encrypted using a JSON Web Token (JWT).

Payments with Instrument Identifier Tokens {#tms-pay-ii-tkn}
============================================================

This section contains information on making payments using instrument identifier tokens.  
An instrument identifier token represents either a payment card number or, in the case of an ACH bank account, the routing and account numbers. The expiration date and billing address fields are pass through fields. The pass-through fields are used for payment network token enrollment with card associations.  
You can make a payment using an existing instrument identifier token or create one. To make a payment using a new instrument identifier token, you must include token creation in the authorization request. For example:

* [Create an Instrument Identifier Token with Validated Payment Details](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-ii-tkn/tms-pay-ii-tkn/tms-ii-create-valid-pay-intro.md "")
  {#tms-pay-ii-tkn_ul_pyh_p4v_qwb}  
  To process a payment using an existing instrument identifier token, you must include the instrument identifier token ID as the value in the `paymentInformation.instrumentIdentifier.id` field. For example:

* [Authorize a Payment with an Instrument Identifier](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-ii-tkn/tms-pay-ii-tkn/tms-ii-tkn-pay-intro.md "")

* [Making a Credit with an Instrument Identifier](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-ii-tkn/tms-pay-ii-tkn/tms-ii-tkn-credit-intro.md "")

Payment Instrument Tokens {#tms-pi-tkn}
=======================================

The payment instrument token contains the complete billing details for the payment type including cardholder name, expiration date, and billing address. These are standalone payment instruments that cannot be associated with a customer.

Manage Payment Instrument Tokens {#tms-manage-pi-tkn}
=====================================================

This section contains information on managing payment instrument tokens.  
A payment instrument represents a means of payment and a payment instrument token stores this information using an instrument identifier token. It does not store the card number and cannot exist without an associated instrument identifier. It can include an instrument identifier, expiration date, billing address, and card type.  
You can create, retrieve, update, or delete an instrument identifier by submitting an HTTP POST, `GET`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` operation to the `tms/v1/paymentinstruments` endpoint. Use the `TMS` REST API payment instrument endpoint to:
* [Create a payment instrument token](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-pi-tkn/tms-manage-pi-tkn/tms-pi-tkn-create-intro.md "")
* [Retrieve a payment instrument token](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-pi-tkn/tms-manage-pi-tkn/tms-pi-tkn-retrieve-intro.md "")
* [Update a payment instrument](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-pi-tkn/tms-manage-pi-tkn/tms-pi-tkn-update-intro.md "")
* [Delete a payment instrument](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-pi-tkn/tms-manage-pi-tkn/tms-pi-tkn-delete-intro.md "")
  {#tms-manage-pi-tkn_ul_g1m_jxw_mwb}

> The response is BASE 64-encoded JSON web encryption (JWE) token. The decoded JWE has these elements:

```
{ "alg": "RSA-OAEP-256", //The algorithm used to encrypt the CEK 
    "cty": "json", //The content type 
    "typ": "JWT", //The token type 
    "enc": "A256GCM", //The algorithm that is used to encrypt the message 
    "kid": "keyId" //The serial number of shared public cert for encryption of CEK
} 
&lt;Encrypted Data&gt; //The encrypted payload that matches the JSON response normally returned by the TMS API, except with an unmasked payment details
```

Header Configuration
--------------------

You must pass this request header to retrieve unmasked payment details: `Accept: application/jose`.  
The term `application/jose` refers to Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE). JOSE is a framework that provides end-to-end security to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-based data structures. JOSE achieves this by offering a collection of specifications to encrypt and digitally sign JSON payloads. In this case, the response is message-level encrypted using a JSON Web Token (JWT).

Payments with Payment Instrument Tokens {#tms-pay-pi-tkn}
=========================================================

This section contains information on making payments with payment instrument tokens.  
A payment instrument represents a means of payment and a payment instrument token stores this information using an instrument identifier token. It does not store the card number and cannot exist without an associated instrument identifier. It can include an instrument identifier, expiration date, billing address, and card type. In the case of non-network token transactions, you can use card or bank account information fields with a payment instrument to make a payment transaction.  
To process a payment using a payment instrument token, you must include the customer token ID as the value in the `paymentInformation.paymentInstrument.id` field. For example:

* [Authorizing a Payment with a Payment Instrument](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-pi-tkn/tms-pay-pi-tkn/tms-pi-tkn-pay-intro.md "")

Retrieve a Customer's Default Payment with an Unmasked Card Number {#tms-cust-tkn-retrieve-default-pay-unmasked-intro}
======================================================================================================================

This section describes how to retrieve a customer's default payment with an unmasked card number.

> IMPORTANT
> To retrieve unmasked payment details, you must ensure that your MLE key pair and your token vault are configured correctly. For more information on MLE keys, see [Token Management Message-Level Encryption Keys](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-mle-setup.md ""). For more information on token vaults, see [Token Vault Management](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-vault-hierarchy.md ""). If necessary, contact your ` Payment Gateway ` account manager or customer support.  
> The response is BASE 64-encoded JSON web encryption (JWE) token. The decoded JWE has these elements:

```
{ "alg": "RSA-OAEP-256", //The algorithm used to encrypt the CEK 
    "cty": "json", //The content type 
    "typ": "JWT", //The token type 
    "enc": "A256GCM", //The algorithm that is used to encrypt the message 
    "kid": "keyId" //The serial number of shared public cert for encryption of CEK
} 
&lt;Encrypted Data&gt; //The encrypted payload that matches the JSON response normally returned by the TMS API, except with an unmasked payment details
```

Header Configuration
--------------------

You must pass this request header to retrieve unmasked payment details: `Accept: application/jose`.  
The term `application/jose` refers to Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE). JOSE is a framework that provides end-to-end security to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-based data structures. JOSE achieves this by offering a collection of specifications to encrypt and digitally sign JSON payloads. In this case, the response is message-level encrypted using a JSON Web Token (JWT).

Payments with Customer Tokens {#tms-pay-cust-tkn}
=================================================

This section contains information on making payments with customer tokens.  
The customer token represents customer-related information including details for a payment card or electronic check, billing address, shipping address, and merchant defined data.  
You can make a payment using an existing customer token or create one. To make a payment using a new customer token, you must include token creation in the authorization request. For example:

* [Create a Customer Token with Validated Payment Details](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-cust-tkn/tms-pay-cust-tkn/tms-cust-tkn-create-valid-pay-intro.md "")
  {#tms-pay-cust-tkn_ul_pyh_p4v_qwb}  
  To process a payment using an existing customer token, you must include the customer token ID as the value in the `paymentInformation.customer.id` field. For example:

* [Authorizing a Payment with a Customer Token](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-cust-tkn/tms-pay-cust-tkn/tms-cust-tkn-pay-intro.md "")

* [Making a Credit with a Customer Token](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-cust-tkn/tms-pay-cust-tkn/tms-cust-tkn-credit-intro.md "")
  {#tms-pay-cust-tkn_ul_sbn_34v_qwb}  
  For more information on customer tokens, see [Customer Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-overview/tms-token-types/tms-cust-tkn-intro.md "").

Shipping Address Tokens {#tms-ship-tkn}
=======================================

The shipping address token contains the shipping address information associated with a customer token. This token includes any shipping address details, including the recipient's first and last name, company, shipping address, email, and phone number. A customer can have one or more shipping addresses, with one allocated as the customer's default shipping address.

Manage Shipping Address Tokens {#tms-manage-ship-addr-tkn}
==========================================================

This section contains information managing shipping address tokens.  
A shipping address token is associated with a customer token. You can create, retrieve, update, or delete an instrument identifier by submitting an HTTP `POST`, `GET`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` operation to the `/tms/v2/customers/`*{customerTokenId}*`/shipping-addresses` endpoint. Use the `TMS` REST API shipping address endpoint to:
* [Create a shipping address token](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-cust-tkn/tms-ship-tkn/tms-ship-addr-tkn-create-intro.md "")

Payments with Shipping Address Tokens {#tms-pay-ship-addr-tkn}
==============================================================

This section contains information on making payments with shipping address tokens.  
A shipping address token is associated with a specific customer token. This includes any shipping address details, including first and last name, company, shipping address, email, and phone number.  
To make a payment using a shipping address token, you must either create the token in the authorization request or include the customer token ID as the value in the `paymentInformation.customer.id` and `paymentInformation.shippingAddress.id` fields. You can make payments using non-default shipping address tokens. For example:

Retrieve a Customer Payment Instrument with an Unmasked Card Number {#tms-cust-pi-tkn-retrieve-unmasked-intro}
==============================================================================================================

This section describes how to retrieve a payment instrument with an unmasked card number.

> IMPORTANT
> To retrieve unmasked payment details, you must ensure that your MLE key pair and your token vault are configured correctly. For more information on MLE keys, see [Token Management Message-Level Encryption Keys](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-mle-setup.md ""). For more information on token vaults, see [Token Vault Management](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding/tms-vault-hierarchy.md ""). If necessary, contact your ` Payment Gateway ` account manager or customer support.  
> The response is BASE 64-encoded JSON web encryption (JWE) token. The decoded JWE has these elements:

```
{ "alg": "RSA-OAEP-256", //The algorithm used to encrypt the CEK 
    "cty": "json", //The content type 
    "typ": "JWT", //The token type 
    "enc": "A256GCM", //The algorithm that is used to encrypt the message 
    "kid": "keyId" //The serial number of shared public cert for encryption of CEK
} 
&lt;Encrypted Data&gt; //The encrypted payload that matches the JSON response normally returned by the TMS API, except with an unmasked payment details
```

Header Configuration
--------------------

You must pass this request header to retrieve unmasked payment details: `Accept: application/jose`.  
The term `application/jose` refers to Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE). JOSE is a framework that provides end-to-end security to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-based data structures. JOSE achieves this by offering a collection of specifications to encrypt and digitally sign JSON payloads. In this case, the response is message-level encrypted using a JSON Web Token (JWT).

Payments with Customer Payment Instruments {#tms-pay-cust-pi-tkn}
=================================================================

This section contains information on making payments with customer payment instrument tokens.  
Customer payment instruments are payment instruments that are linked to a specific customer token. The following payment instruments are supported:

* Payment card

* Tokenized card (Apple Pay and Android Pay)

* ACH bank account

`Payment Passkey` {#tms-passkey-intro}
======================================

`Payment Passkey` is an e-commerce authentication solution that is built on Fast Identity Online (FIDO). `Payment Passkey` uses device-based authentication to provide a consistent and secure payment experience. `Payment Passkey` provides a streamlined customer experience and enhances security by standardizing local authentication. `Payment Passkey` also offers eligibility for liability shift under the digital authentication framework.  
A `Payment Passkey` credential is assigned to a device and card combination after a successful cardholder authentication. You can use this `Payment Passkey` credential during cardholder checkout when the same device and payment card are used. This avoids repeated calls to the issuer and optimizes the cardholder's payment experience.

> IMPORTANT This feature is in the pilot phase. You have early access to this feature even though it might contain bugs or unfinished work. You should consider the risk when using this feature.

`Payment Passkey` Workflow {#tms-passkey-intro_section-workflow}
----------------------------------------------------------------

This workflow illustrates the process of integrating to Passkey Service and binding a network token to a device or browser. There are three possible outcomes when you send a request to determine if FIDO authentication is available for a network token:

* `AUTHENTICATE`: The device and network token combination is already registered with `Payment Passkey` and enrollment and step-up are not required. The cardholder can authenticate immediately using their passkey. See [Authenticate with Passkey](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-passkey-intro/tms-net-tkn-card-authenticate.md "").
* `AUTHENTICATION_REGISTRATION`: No `Payment Passkey` exists yet for the device and tokenized card combination and the device and token are eligible to be registered with `Payment Passkey`. You must register a passkey before authentication can take place. See [Register a Passkey and Authenticate](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-passkey-intro/tms-net-tkn-card-registration.md "").
* `STEP_UP_AUTHENTICATION`: The device and tokenized card is not yet registered with `Payment Passkey` and the issuer has challenged the device binding. You must complete an issuer‑required step‑up authentication before the device can be approved and passkey registration can proceed. See [Step-up Authentication for Registration](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-passkey-intro/tms-net-tkn-card-stepup.md "").

Iframe Requirements {#tms-iframe-mapping}
=========================================

This section describes the required credentials and field mappings for your iframe.

Token Requestor --- Token Service Provider Iframe Credentials
-------------------------------------------------------------

You must use Token Requestor --- Token Service Provider (TR-TSP) keys to communicate with the Relay Token Service (VTS) iframe. You can use these keys to create the session information for VTS and Passkey Service. For information on iframes and the Relay Token Service SDK, you must contact your account manager.

> IMPORTANT
> The API key values for the apikey credential will expire in September 2027.

Authenticate with Passkey {#tms-net-tkn-card-authenticate}
==========================================================

When you request authentication options for a tokenized card, the response indicates which `Payment Passkey` sequence to take for the current device and token combination:

* `AUTHENTICATE`
* `AUTHENTICATION_REGISTRATION`
* `STEP_UP_AUTHENTICATION`  
  This section describes what to do when the action field in your request to the `/tms/v2/tokenized-cards/`*{tokenId}*`/authentication-options` endpoint returns a value of `AUTHENTICATE`. When you get this response, a passkey exists for the device and card and the user must authenticate using their existing passkey. The authentication takes places through the iframe. For information about the `Payment Passkey` flow, see [Payment Passkey](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-passkey-intro.md "").  
  When the action field in your request to the `/tms/v2/tokenized-cards/`*{tokenId}*`/authentication-options` endpoint returns a value of `AUTHENTICATE`, the device and network token combination is registered with `Payment Passkey`  
  Follow these steps to create a cryptogram that supplies authenticated `Payment Passkey` credentials:

Step 1: Cardholder authentication with FIDO {#tms-net-tkn-card-authenticate-step1}
==================================================================================

The cardholder authenticates with FIDO using the URL from the merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.url field sent to the `/tms/v2/tokenized-cards/`*{tokenId}*`/authentication-options` endpoint.

Step 2: Create payment credentials with FIDO data {#tms-net-tkn-card-authenticate-step2}
========================================================================================

This section describes how create a cryptogram that supplies authenticated Passkey Service credentials.

Register a Passkey and Authenticate {#tms-net-tkn-card-registration}
====================================================================

When you request authentication options for a tokenized card, the response indicates which `Payment Passkey` sequence to take for the current device and token combination:

* `AUTHENTICATE`
* `AUTHENTICATION_REGISTRATION`
* `STEP_UP_AUTHENTICATION`  
  This section describes what to do when the action field in your request to the `/tms/v2/tokenized-cards/`*{tokenId}*`/authentication-options` endpoint returns a value of `AUTHENTICATION_REGISTRATION`. When the response returns `AUTHENTICATION_REGISTRATION`, no passkey exists yet but the device has been approved and the user must complete a one‑time passkey registration. For information about the `Payment Passkey` flow, see [Payment Passkey](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-passkey-intro.md "").  
  Follow these steps to register a device and network token combination with `Payment Passkey`:

Step 2: Cardholder authentication with FIDO {#tms-net-tkn-card-reg-step2}
=========================================================================

The cardholder authenticates with FIDO using the URL from the merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.url field sent to the `/tms/v2/tokenized-cards/`*{tokenId}*`/authentication-registrations` endpoint.

Step 3: Create payment credentials with FIDO data {#tms-net-tkn-card-reg-step3}

Step-up Authentication for Registration {#tms-net-tkn-card-stepup}
==================================================================

When you request authentication options for a tokenized card, the response indicates which `Payment Passkey` sequence to take for the current device and token combination:

* `AUTHENTICATE`
* `AUTHENTICATION_REGISTRATION`
* `STEP_UP_AUTHENTICATION`  
  This section describes what to do when the action field in your request to the `/tms/v2/tokenized-cards/`*{tokenId}*`/authentication-options` endpoint returns a value of `STEP_UP_AUTHENTICATION`. When the response returns `STEP_UP_AUTHENTICATION`, the issuer requires additional verification before the device can be approved and passkey registration can proceed. Example verification includes one-time password (OTP), issuer application approval, or phone verification. For information about the `Payment Passkey` flow, see [Payment Passkey](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-passkey-intro.md "").  
  These step-up options are available:

One-time password (OTP)
:
You can get a one-time password using these methods:

    * **Email OTP** : stepUpOptions.method is set to `OTP_EMAIL`.
    * **Issuer account OTP** : stepUpOptions.method is set to `OTP_ONLINE_BANKING`.
    * **SMS OTP** : stepUpOptions.method is set to `OTP_SMS`.

Issuer Application
:
You can authenticate in an issuer application using these methods:

    * **Issuer application with backend Relay integration** : stepUpOptions.method is set to `APP_TO_APP`.
    * **Issuer application returns issuer authentication code** : stepUpOptions.method is set to `APP_TO_APP`.
    * **Issuer `3-D Secure`** : stepUpOptions.method is set to `APP_TO_APP` and deviceInformation.platformType is set to `WEB`.

Phone Issuer
:
You can authenticate over the phone using these methods:

    * **Cardholder calls issuer call center** : stepUpOptions.method is set to `CUSTOMERSERVICE`.
    * **Issuer calls cardholder** : stepUpOptions.method is set to `OUTBOUNDCALL`.

Classic Cloud Token Framework {#tms-ctf-intro}
==============================================

The Cloud Token Framework (CTF) is the framework for binding a device and a network token. CTF enables merchants to perform one-time issuer identification and verification and securely binds a user's device to a payment network token. CTF reduces fraud rates and improves transaction conversion.

> IMPORTANT CTF is supported only in mobile in-app experiences.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to send device binding requests, you must have a self-signed certificate associated with your merchant account. See [Cloud Token Framework Key Generation](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-ctf-intro/tms-ctf-key-gen.md "").  
A token requestor must pass local authentication information. The token requestor can select up to two of these authentication factors for the cardholder to verify their identity at checkout:

Knowledge
:
Knowledge verification factors include information that only the cardholder knows. For example, a password.

Possession
:
Possession verification factors include something that only the cardholder has. For example, a pre-registered mobile phone, a card reader, or a key generation device.

Inherence
:
Inherence verification factors include something that the cardholder is. For example, biometric data. Biometric data includes facial recognition, a fingerprint, voice recognition, or a behavioral biometric.
IMPORTANT In markets where two-factor authentication is a regulatory requirement, token requestors must send both authentication factors and the two selected factors should be mutually independent. In all other markets, token requestors will have to perform single-factor authentication as a minimum requirement.

Cloud Token Framework Key Generation {#tms-ctf-key-gen}
=======================================================

Follow these steps to generate the credentials required to send device binding requests:  
![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/tms/images/tms-ctf-key-gen-650x175.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
When you follow these steps you create these files:

* `root-ca-private-key.pem`
* `root-ca-certificate.pem`
* `device-signing-private-key.pem`
* `device-signing.csr`
* `device-signing-certificate.pem`

[Cloud Token Framework Keys and Descriptions]

1. Create your master key (`root-ca-private-key.pem`) and certificate (`root-ca-certificate.pem`).

   > IMPORTANT
   > Do not share ` root-ca-private-key.pem `.  
   > Example command:

   ```
   # Private CA key (keep offline, never share)
   openssl genrsa -out root-ca-private-key.pem 2048

   # Self-signed CA certificate (public) with proper CA extensions
   openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key root-ca-private-key.pem -days 3650 -out root-ca-certificate.pem
   ```
2. Generate a signing key pair for each device. This creates `device-signing-private-key.pem`, `device-signing.csr`, and `device-signing-certificate.pem`.

   ```
   # Device signing private key
   openssl genrsa -out device-signing-private-key.pem 2048

   # Certificate signing request (CSR) for the device signing key
   openssl req -new -key device-signing-private-key.pem -out device-signing.csr

   # Issue the device signing certificate from your CA
   openssl x509 -req -in device-signing.csr -CA root-ca-certificate.pem -CAkey root-ca-private-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out device-signing-certificate.pem -days 500 -outform PEM
   ```
3. (Optional) Validate your certificates.  
   Example command:

   ```
   # Verify that device-signing-certificate.pem chains to root-ca-certificate.pem
   openssl verify -CAfile root-ca-certificate.pem device-signing-certificate.pem

   # Verify that data signed with device-signing-private-key.pem matches device-signing-certificate.pem
   openssl x509 -in device-signing-certificate.pem -pubkey -noout &gt; device-signing-public-key.pem
   echo 'test' &gt; message.txt
   openssl dgst -sha256 -sign device-signing-private-key.pem -out message.sig message.txt
   openssl dgst -sha256 -verify device-signing-public-key.pem -signature message.sig message.txt
   ```

Bind a Device ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/tms/images/tms-ctf-device-600x400.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The customer sends a request to the merchant that they consent to bind the device.
2. If the device is not enrolled, the merchant sends a request to `TMS` to enroll the device.
   1. **Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/tms/v2/devices`
3. If the device is enrolled, the merchant sends a request to `TMS` to bind the device using the device ID.
   1. **Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/tms/v2/tokenized-cards/{id}/bindings`
4. `TMS` sends a binding request to the issuer with the binding ID.
5. The issuer sends a response to `TMS` with the binding status.
6. If authentication is valid, `TMS` binds the token to the device.
7. The issuer notifies `TMS` that binding was successful.
8. `TMS` sends a response to the merchant that the binding is completed.
9. The merchant notifies the customer that their device binding is complete.

   1. **Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/tms/v2/tokenized-cards/{id}/bindings`
4. `TMS` sends a binding request to the issuer with the binding ID.
5. The issuer sends a response to `TMS` with a step-up authentication binding status.
6. `TMS` sends a request to the issuer for authentication methods.
7. The issuer sends a list of authentication methods that are passed on to the customer.
8. The customer selects their authentication method and it is sent to the issuer.
9. The issuer initiates authentication method.
10. If authentication is valid, `TMS` binds the token to the device.
11. The issuer notifies `TMS` that binding was successful.
12. `TMS` sends a response to the merchant that the binding is completed.
13. The merchant notifies the customer that their device binding is complete.

This section describes how to validate one-time passwords (OTPs) and issuer authentication codes. When the cardholder receives their OTP by means of their selected method (SMS, email, or online banking) or an issuer authentication code from their banking application, you can verify the OTP or issuer authentication code by including it in the endpoint here.

Tap to Add Card {#tms-tap-intro}
================================

The Tap to Add Card feature provides the cardholder with the ability to save their card credentials with you by tapping their contactless card to the back of their compatible device when using your application. You can then send a token provisioning request that contains EMV chip data to `TMS`. This reduces token provisioning fraud, proves possession of the card, and reduces room for manual errors.  
Tap to Add Card is available for Relay card brands.

> IMPORTANT This feature is in pilot phase. You have early access to this feature even though it might contain bugs or unfinished work. Please consider the risk when using this feature.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before using Tap to Add Card, you must meet these requirements:

* You must be configured for `TMS`. See [Token Management Service Onboarding](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-onboarding.md "").
* Network tokens must be enabled. For more information, see [Network Token Enablement](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-net-tkn-onboard/tms-net-tkn-enablement.md "").

Tap to Add Card Workflow
------------------------

This workflow illustrates the process of using the Tap to Add Card feature.

#### Figure:

Tap to Add Card Workflow ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/tms/images/tms-tap-to-add-card-650x545.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The cardholder navigates to add a new payment method in your application.

2. You provide the cardholder with a list of payment options, including Tap to Add Card.

3. The cardholder selects **Tap to Add Card** and taps their card against the device.

4. You read the PAN and EMV data from your application.

5. You send all of the required EMV data to `TMS`.

   1. See [Create an Instrument Identifier and Network Token Using EMV Tags](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-ii-tkn/tms-manage-ii-tkn/tms-tap-create-ii-intro.md "").

   1. (Optional) Your application prompts the cardholder to enter their card verification value (CVV2) data.
6. `TMS` creates a `TMS` token and a network token with EMV tags.

7. Relay performs cryptogram validation on your behalf. When the cryptogram validation is successful, Relay forwards the provision request to the card issuer with PAN Source = 6 and the CVV2 (if available).

8. The card issuer approves or declines the provision request.

9. Relay generates a token upon issuer approval and sends the token to `TMS`.

10. You notify the cardholder that the card-on-file (COF) token was provisioned.

Card Art {#tms-card-art}
========================

IMPORTANT This feature is in pilot phase. You have early access to this feature even though it might contain bugs or unfinished work. Please consider the risk when using this feature.  
You can choose to display card art provided by `TMS` to help your customers identify the card that they are selecting. `Payment Gateway` recommends that card art be shown in all cardholder-facing interactions where it applies.  
Card art is available for these card types:

* American Express
* Mastercard
* Relay

Retrieve Card Art {#tms-net-tkn-card-art-retrieve-intro}
========================================================

This section describes how to retrieve card assets.  
You can retrieve card art content when you retrieve a `TMS` token that is linked to a network token, such as an instrument identifier. For more information, see [Retrieve an Instrument Identifier](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-ii-tkn/tms-manage-ii-tkn/tms-ii-tkn-retrieve-intro.md "").

When some types of tokens are provisioned, `TMS` returns the BIN details that are provided by the BIN Lookup Service. This section describes how to retrieve the BIN information provided by the BIN Lookup Service for a PAN or network token.

> IMPORTANT
> You must be enabled for network tokenization to retrieve BIN details using ` TMS `.  
> `TMS` returns BIN data when you send a request to create or retrieve these token types:

* [Payment instrument tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-pi-tkn.md "")
* [Instrument identifier tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/tms-ii-tkn.md "")  
  For more information about using the BIN Lookup Service, see the [*BIN Lookup Service Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/bin-lookup/developer/all/rest/bin-lookup/bin-lookup-about-guide.md "")

This section describes how to retrieve the payment credentials for a Relay Token Service (VTS) network token that is used for account funding transactions (AFTs). You can retrieve these payment credentials for a VTS network token:

* VTS network token value
* AFT cryptogram (Relay only)  
  The VTS network token payment credentials are returned as a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) response.

> IMPORTANT You must contact your Relay representative to ensure that your system is enabled to retrieve an AFT cryptogram.

Create a Digital Signature Key {#wh-fg-key-dig-sig-intro}
=========================================================

Use the information in this section to create a *digital signature key*. The Digital Signature Key request uses Relay's key management service to store your credentials. The Webhooks platform retrieves your credentials from key management to digitally authenticate your notifications.  
You must create a digital signature key to enable `Payment Gateway` to send notifications to your servers. Replace the digital signature key every year. When you generate a new digital signature key, it overrides the old key and new transactions must use the new key.  
Notifications that use message-level encryption must also the digital signature key.

> IMPORTANT Store the created digital signature key in a secure location in your system.

Optional Notification Validation
--------------------------------

After you set up a webhook subscription, you can validate each notification you receive using your digital signature key. For more information, see [Validating a Notification with the Digital Signature Key](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/wh-fg-optional-validate-intro.md "").

Endpoints

Send a POST request to one of these endpoints:

* **Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/kms/egress/v2/keys-sym`
* **Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/kms/egress/v2/keys-sym`
* **India Production:** `POST https://api.in.example.com/kms/egress/v2/keys-sym`

Validating a Notification with the Digital Signature Key {#wh-fg-optional-validate-intro}
=========================================================================================

You can use the digital signature key to verify that the webhook notifications you receive are from `Payment Gateway`. Verifying your webhook notifications validates their integrity and helps prevent replay attacks.  
When you receive a webhook notification from `Payment Gateway`, it contains a digital signature key. You can configure your system to compare the notification's digital signature to the digital signature you created. If the digital signatures match, the notification is validated.  
Complete these tasks to validate the webhook notifications that you receive:
1. Create a digital signature key by sending a *create a digital signature key* request to `Payment Gateway`. You may have already completed this requirement while setting up your first webhook subscription. For more information, see [Create a Digital Signature Key](/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/all/rest/tms/wh-fg-key-dig-sig-intro.md "").
2. Extract the digital signature from the digital signature key that you created.
3. Configure your system to compare your digital signature to the digital signatures in the notifications that you receive. A webhook notification is valid if the notification's digital signature matches your digital signature.
