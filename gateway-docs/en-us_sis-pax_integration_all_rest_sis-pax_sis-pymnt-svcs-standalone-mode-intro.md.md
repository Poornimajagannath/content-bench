Standalone Mode Payment Services {#sis-pymnt-svcs-standalone-mode-intro}
========================================================================

Use this information to process payment services available in the Acceptance Devices app when operated in Standalone mode.  
These are some benefits of using Standalone mode:

* You can start transactions directly from the terminal.

* This mode is the fastest way to begin accepting payments.

* There is no integration required when using this mode with a point-of-sale (POS) system.

* Use this mode as a backup option when your POS system is unavailable for Local or Cloud semi-integrated modes.
  {#sis-pymnt-svcs-standalone-mode-intro_ul_f1b_dhp_vzb}
  IMPORTANT When the Acceptance Devices app is in Standalone mode, the terminal does not communicate with your POS system to exchange transaction details. You are responsible for reconciling transactions with your internal systems and records.  
  For information about other modes available in the Acceptance Devices app, see:

* [Local Mode Payment Services](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/semi-integrated-pymnt-svcs-intro.md "")

* [Cloud Mode Payment Services](/docs/gateway/en-us/sis-pax/integration/all/rest/sis-pax/sis-pymnt-svcs-cloud-mode-intro.md "")
