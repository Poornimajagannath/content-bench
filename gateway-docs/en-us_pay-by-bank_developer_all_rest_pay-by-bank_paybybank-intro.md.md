Introduction to Pay by Bank {#paybybank-intro}
==============================================

Pay by Bank is a solution that enables you to offer your e-commerce customers the ability to pay directly from their bank account in real time without providing payment card information. When a payment is processed, your customer's bank transfers the funds directly to your merchant bank account.  
In the UK, Pay by Bank follows the open banking regulations for bank-to-bank transfers.
