`Secure Acceptance` `Checkout API` Overview {#home-merch}
=========================================================

`Payment Gateway` `Secure Acceptance` `Checkout API` provides a seamless customer checkout experience that keeps your branding consistent. You can create a `Secure Acceptance` `Checkout API` profile and configure the required settings to set up your customer checkout experience.  
`Secure Acceptance` `Checkout API` can significantly simplify your Payment Card Industry Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance by sending sensitive payment card data directly from your customer's browser to `Payment Gateway` servers. Your web application infrastructure does not come into contact with the sensitive payment data and the transition is silent.

> ` Secure Acceptance ` is designed to process transaction requests directly from the customer browser so that sensitive payment data does not pass through your servers. If you do intend to send payment data from your servers, use the [REST API](https://developer.example.com ""), [SOAP Toolkit API,](http://www.example.com/developers/integration_methods/simple_order_and_soap_toolkit_api/ "") or the [Simple Order API](http://www.example.com/developers/integration_methods/simple_order_and_soap_toolkit_api/ ""). Sending server-side payments using ` Secure Acceptance ` incurs unnecessary overhead and could result in the suspension of your ` Secure Acceptance ` profile and subsequent failure of transactions.
> To create your customer's `Secure Acceptance` experience, you take these steps:

1. Create and configure `Secure Acceptance` `Checkout API` profiles.
2. Update the code on your web site to POST payment data directly to `Payment Gateway` from your secure payment form. See [Sample Transaction Process Using JSP](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-samples-scripting-languages/sa-sample-txn-process-using-jsp.md ""). `Payment Gateway` processes the transaction on your behalf by sending an approval request to your payment processor in real time. See [Secure Acceptance Checkout API Transaction Flow](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/home-merch/sa-checkout-api-flow.md "").
3. Use the response information to generate an appropriate transaction response page to display to the customer. You can view and manage all orders in the Business Center. You can configure the payment options, response pages, and customer notifications. See [Creating a Secure Acceptance Profile](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-configuration/sa-both-intro-create-sa-profile.md "").

`Secure Acceptance` Profile {#sa-hosted-payments-profile}
=========================================================

A Secure Acceptance profile consists of settings that you configure to create a customer checkout experience. You can create and edit multiple profiles, each offering a custom checkout experience. For example, you might want to offer different payment options for different geographic locations.

`Secure Acceptance` `Checkout API` Transaction Flow {#sa-checkout-api-flow}
===========================================================================

#### Figure: {#sa-checkout-api-flow_sa-checkout-api-flow}

`Secure Acceptance` `Checkout API` Transaction Flow ![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/secure-acceptance/images/Secure_Acceptance_SOP.bmp/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg)

1. Display the checkout page on your customer's browser with a form to collect their payment information and include a signature to validate their order information (signed data fields).

   > Your system should sign all request fields with the exception of fields that contain data the customer is entering. To prevent malicious actors from impersonating ` Payment Gateway `, do not allow unauthorized access to the signing function.

2. The customer enters and submits their payment details (the unsigned data fields). The transaction request message, the signature, and the signed and unsigned data fields are sent directly from your customer's browser to the `Payment Gateway` servers. The unsigned data fields do not pass through your network.  
   `Payment Gateway` reviews and validates the transaction request data to confirm it has not been amended or tampered with and that it contains valid authentication credentials. `Payment Gateway` processes the transaction and creates and signs the response message. The response message is sent to the customer's browser as an automated HTTPS form POST.

   > If the response signature in the response field does not match the signature calculated based on the response data, treat the POST as malicious and disregard it.  
   > Secure Acceptance signs every response field. Ignore any response fields in the POST that are not in the signed_fields field.

3. The response HTTPS POST data contains the transaction result in addition to the masked payment data that was collected outside of your domain. Validate the response signature to confirm that the response data has not been amended or tampered with.  
   If the transaction type is `sale`, it is immediately submitted for settlement. If the transaction type is `authorization`, use the Simple Order API to submit a capture request when goods are shipped.
4. `Payment Gateway` recommends that you implement the merchant POST URL notification as a backup means of determining the transaction result. This method does not rely on your customer's browser. You receive the transaction result even if your customer lost connection after confirming the payment. See [Merchant Notifications](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-configuration/sa-merchant-notifications.md "").

Payment Tokens {#sa-payment-tokens}
===================================

Contact ` Payment Gateway ` Customer Support to activate your merchant account for the ` Token Management Service ` (` TMS `). You cannot use payment tokens until your account is activated and you have enabled payment tokens for ` Secure Acceptance `. See [Creating a Secure Acceptance Profile](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-configuration/sa-both-intro-create-sa-profile.md "").  
Payment tokens are unique identifiers that replace sensitive payment information and that cannot be mathematically reversed. `Payment Gateway` securely stores all the card information, replacing it with the payment token. The token is also known as a subscription ID, which you store on your server.  
The payment tokenization solution is compatible with the Relay and Mastercard Account Updater service. Card data stored with `Payment Gateway` is automatically updated by participating banks, thereby reducing payment failures. See the Account Updater User Guide ([PDF](http://apps.example.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/Account_Updater_UG/Account_Updater.pdf "") \| [HTML](http://apps.example.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/Account_Updater_UG/html/ "")).  
The payment token replaces the card or ACH bank account number, and optionally the associated billing, shipping, and card information. No sensitive card information is stored on your servers, thereby reducing your PCI DSS obligations.

Tokens That Represent a Card or Bank Account Only {#sa-tokens-for-card-or-bank-acct-only}
=========================================================================================

Instrument identifier tokens created using the Token Management Service (TMS) and third-party tokens represent a payment card number or bank account number. The same card number or bank account number sent in multiple token creation calls results in the same payment token being returned. TMS instrument identifier and third-party tokens cannot be updated. If your merchant account is configured for one of these token types, you receive an error if you attempt to update a token.  
When using `Secure Acceptance` with tokens that represent only the card number or bank account, you must include associated data, such as expiration dates and billing address data, in your transaction request.

Subscription Payments {#sa-subscription-payments}
=================================================

A customer subscription contains information that you store in the `Payment Gateway` database and use for future billing. At any time, you can send a request to bill the customer for an amount you specify, and `Payment Gateway` uses the payment token to retrieve the card, billing, and shipping information to process the transaction. You can also view the customer subscription in the Business Center. See [Viewing Transactions in the Business Center](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-test-view-txns/sa-view-txns-in-business-center.md "").  
A customer subscription includes:

* Customer contact information, such as billing and shipping information.
* Customer payment information, such as card type, masked account number, and expiration date.
* Customer order information, such as the transaction reference number and merchant-defined data fields.

| Type of Subscription |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recurring            | A recurring billing service with no specific end date. You must specify the amount and frequency of each payment and the start date for processing the payments. `Payment Gateway` creates a schedule based on this information and automatically bills the customer according to the schedule. For example, you can offer an online service that the customer subscribes to and can charge a monthly fee for this service. See [Recurring Payments](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-txns/sa-recurring-payments.md "").                          |
| Installment          | A recurring billing service with a fixed number of scheduled payments. You must specify the number of payments, the amount and frequency of each payment, and the start date for processing the payments. `Payment Gateway` creates a schedule based on this information and automatically bills the customer according to the schedule. For example, you can offer a product for 75.00 and let the customer pay in three installments of 25.00. See [Installment Payments](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-txns/sa-installment-payments.md ""). |
[Subscription Types]

Level II and III Data {#sa-level2-level3-data}
==============================================

`Secure Acceptance` supports Level II and III data. Level II cards, also known as Type II cards, provide customers with additional information on their payment card statements. Business and corporate cards along with purchase and procurement cards are considered Level II cards.  
Level III data can be provided for purchase cards, which are payment cards used by employees to make purchases for their company. You provide additional detailed information---the Level III data---about the purchase card order during the settlement process. The Level III data is forwarded to the company that made the purchase, and it enables the company to manage its purchasing activities.  
For detailed descriptions of each Level II and Level III field, see Level II and Level III Processing Using Secure Acceptance ([PDF](http://apps.example.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/Secure_Acceptance_LII/Level_II_III_Secure_Acceptance.pdf "") \| [HTML](http://apps.example.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/Secure_Acceptance_LII/html "")). This guide also describes how to request sale and capture transactions.

9. Click Submit. The card types are added as an accepted payment type.

10. Click Save.

Payer Authentication Configuration {#sa-payer-auth-configuration}
=================================================================

*Payer Authentication* is the `Payment Gateway` implementation of 3-D Secure. It prevents unauthorized card use and provides added protection from fraudulent chargeback activity. `Secure Acceptance` supports 3-D Secure 1.0 and 2.0.  
Before you can use Payer Authentication, you must contact Customer Support to configure your account. Your merchant ID must be enabled for payer authentication. For more information about payer authentication, see the [Payer Authentication Developer Guides](https://developer.example.com/docs.md#PayerAuthentication "").  
For `Secure Acceptance`, `Payment Gateway` supports these kinds of payer authentication:

* American Express SafeKey
* China UnionPay (3-D Secure 2.0 only)
* Diners ProtectBuy
* J/Secure by JCB
* Mastercard Identity Check
* Relay Secure  
  For each transaction, you receive detailed information in the replies and in the transaction details page of the `Business Center`. You can store this information for 12 months. `Payment Gateway` recommends that you store the payer authentication data because you can be required to display this information as enrollment verification for any payer authentication transaction that you present again because of a chargeback.  
  Your merchant account provider can require that you provide all data in human-readable format.  
  The language used on each payer authentication page is determined by your issuing bank and overrides the locale you have specified. If you use the test card numbers for testing purposes the default language used on the payer authentication page is English and overrides the locale you have specified. See [Test and View Transactions](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-test-view-txns.md "").

* **Test** : [businesscentertest.example.com](https://businesscentertest.example.com "")
* **Production** : [businesscenter.example.com](https://businesscenter.example.com "")
* **Production in India** : [businesscenter.in.example.com](https://businesscenter.in.example.com "")

On the Profile Settings page, click Security. The Security Keys page appears. The security script signs the request fields using the secret key and the HMAC SHA256 algorithm. To verify data, the security script generates a signature to compare with the signature returned from the `Secure Acceptance` server.

Merchant Notifications {#sa-merchant-notifications}
===================================================

`Secure Acceptance` sends merchant and customer notifications in response to transactions. You can receive a merchant notification by email or as an HTTPS POST to a URL for each transaction processed. Both notifications contain the same transaction result data.  
Ensure that your system acknowledges POST notifications (even when under load) as quickly as possible. Delays of more than 10 seconds might result in delays to future POST notifications.
` Payment Gateway ` recommends that you implement the merchant POST URL to receive notification of each transaction. Parse the transaction response sent to the merchant POST URL and store the data within your order management system. This ensures the accuracy of the transactions and informs you when the transaction was successfully processed.

Payer Authentication Configuration {#sa-payer-auth-configuration-reseller}
==========================================================================

Payer authentication is the `Payment Gateway` implementation of 3-D Secure. It deters unauthorized card use and provides added protection from fraudulent chargeback activity. `Secure Acceptance` supports 3-D Secure 1.0 and 2.0.  
Before you can use `Payment Gateway` Payer Authentication, you must contact `Payment Gateway` Customer Support so that `Payment Gateway` can configure your account. Your merchant ID must be enabled for payer authentication. For more information about payer authentication, see the [Payer Authentication Developer Guides](https://developer.example.com/docs.md#PayerAuthentication "").  
For `Secure Acceptance`, `Payment Gateway` supports these kinds of payer authentication:

* American Express SafeKey
* China UnionPay (3-D Secure 2.0 only)
* Diners ProtectBuy
* J/Secure by JCB
* Mastercard Identity Check
* Relay Secure  
  For each transaction, you receive detailed information in the replies and in the transaction details page of the Business Center. You can store this information for 12 months. `Payment Gateway` recommends that you store the payer authentication data because you can be required to display this information as enrollment verification for any payer authentication transaction that you present again because of a chargeback.  
  Your merchant account provider can require that you provide all data in human-readable format.  
  The language used on each payer authentication page is determined by your issuing bank and overrides the locale that you specified. If you use the test card numbers, the default language used on the payer authentication page is English and overrides the locale you have specified. See [Test and View Transactions](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-test-view-txns.md "").

=======================================================================================

1. In the left navigation panel, choose Portfolio Management \&gt; Secure Acceptance Profiles. The `Secure Acceptance` Profile page appears.

2. Choose a profile. The General Settings page appears.

3. Click Customer Response. The Customer Response page appears.

4. Enter the URL for your customer response page. Use port 80, 443, or 8080 in the URL.

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   Only port 443 should be used with an HTTPS URL.  
   A POST request with the transaction data is provided to this URL after the customer completes checkout.  
   The POST request contains the reason code value of the transaction, which helps you determine possible actions to take on the transaction.  
   See [Reason Codes](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-reason-codes.md "").

5. Click Save.

1. In the left navigation panel, choose Portfolio Management \&gt; `Secure Acceptance` Profiles. The `Secure Acceptance` Profile page appears.
2. Perform one of these steps:
   * On the Active Profiles tab, choose a profile and click Publish Profile.
   * On the Edit Profile page, click Publish Profile.
3. Click Confirm.

Reseller: Additional Profile Options {#sa-additional-profile-options-reseller}
==============================================================================

* Copy---duplicates the active profile and creates an editable version. The editable version is listed in the inactive profile list. This option is available only for an active profile.
* Deactivate---deactivates the active profile. The profile is now listed in the inactive profile list. This option is available only for an active profile.
* Publish to Active---activates the inactive profile. This option is available only for an inactive profile.

Scripting Language Samples {#sa-samples-scripting-languages}
============================================================

`Secure Acceptance` can support any dynamic scripting language that supports HMAC256 hashing algorithms.  
Select the scripting language you use to download a sample script:

* [ASP.NET (C#)](http://apps.example.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/samples/sa_sop/csharp_sop.zip "")
* [JSP](http://apps.example.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/samples/sa_sop/jsp_sop.zip "")
* [Perl](http://apps.example.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/samples/sa_sop/perl_sop.zip "")
* [PHP](http://apps.example.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/samples/sa_sop/php_sop.zip "")
* [Ruby](http://apps.example.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/samples/sa_sop/ruby_sop.zip "")
* [VB](http://apps.example.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/samples/sa_sop/vb_sop.zip "")

Sample Transaction Process Using JSP {#sa-sample-txn-process-using-jsp}
=======================================================================

1. ***signeddatafields.jsp*** file---paste your access key and profile ID into their respective fields. The customer enters billing, shipping, and other information. POST the fields to your server to sign and create the signature. The fields must be included in the signed_field_names field as a CSV list.

2. ***security.jsp*** file---security algorithm signs fields and creates a signature using the signed_field_names field. Enter your security key in the SECRET_KEY field. Modify the security script to include the Secret Key that you generated in [Security Keys](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-configuration/sa-security-keys.md "").

   #### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   The security algorithm in each security script sample is responsible for:

   * Request authentication---the signature is generated on the merchant server by the keyed-HMAC signing the request parameters using the shared secret key. This process is also carried out on the `Secure Acceptance` server, and the two signatures are compared for authenticity.
   * Response authentication---the signature is generated on the `Secure Acceptance` server by HMAC signing the response parameters, using the shared secret key. This process is also carried out on the merchant server, and the two signatures are compared for authenticity.
3. ***unsigneddatafields.jsp*** file---customer enters their payment information: card type, card number, and card expiry date. Include these fields in the unsigned_field_names field. POST the transaction to the Secure Acceptance endpoint.

[Endpoints]

Required Signed Fields {#sa-required-signed-fields}
===================================================

Signing fields protects them from malicious actors adding or changing transaction data during transmission. To sign fields, include them in a comma-separated string in the signed_field_names field in your request. To prevent data tampering, include all request fields in the signed_field_names field with the exception of the card_number , card_cvn , and signature .  
These signed fields are required in all `Secure Acceptance` requests:

* access_key
* amount
* currency
* locale
* payment_method
* profile_id
* reference_number
* signed_date_time
* signed_field_names
* transaction_type
* transaction_uuid
* unsigned_field_names  
  For descriptions of these fields, see [Request Fields](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-wm-api-fields/sa-request-fields.md "").

Payment Tokens {#sa-payment-tokens-reseller}
============================================

Creating a Payment Card Token {#sa-create-payment-card-token}
=============================================================

Include the appropriate endpoint that supports the ` create_payment_token ` transaction type. See [Endpoints and Transaction Types](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-txns/sa-endpoints-txn-types.md ""). For descriptions of all request and response fields. See [Checkout API Fields](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-wm-api-fields.md "").  
Include all request fields in the signed_field_names field with the exception of the card_number, card_cvn, and signature fields. The signed_field_names field is used to generate a signature that is used to verify the content of the transaction in order to prevent data tampering.

`Decision Manager` {#sa-custom-fme-dm}
======================================

Contact Customer Support to enable the ` Decision Manager ` verbose data mode for your merchant account and to obtain detailed information regarding the device fingerprint.  
`Decision Manager` is a hosted fraud management tool that enables you to identify legitimate orders quickly and that reduces the need to manually intervene in your order review process. You can accurately identify and review potentially risky transactions while minimizing the rejection of valid orders. With `Secure Acceptance`, you can use `Decision Manager` to screen orders containing travel data. Include the complete route or the individual legs of the trip, or both. If you include both, the value for the complete route is used.  
`Decision Manager` obtains data about the geographical location of a customer by linking the IP address extracted from the customer's browser to the country and the payment card. Add the customer's IP address to the customer_ip_address field and include it in the request.  
Verbose mode returns detailed information about an order, and it returns the decision of each rule that the order triggered. Rules that are evaluated as true are returned with the appropriate results and field names, but rules that are evaluated as false are not returned.  
These are the optional `Decision Manager` fields:

* consumer_id
* complete_route
* customer_cookies_accepted
* customer_gift_wrap
* customer_ip_address
* departure_time
* date_of_birth
* device_fingerprint_id---the device fingerprint ID generated by the platform overrides the merchant-generated device fingerprint ID.
* journey_leg#_orig
* journey_leg#_dest
* journey_type
* merchant_defined_data#
* item_#_passenger_forename
* item_#_passenger_email
* item_#_passenger_id
* item_#_passenger_surname
* item_#_passenger_status
* item_#_passenger_type
* returns_accepted

For detailed descriptions of all request fields, see [Request Fields](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-wm-api-fields/sa-request-fields.md ""). For detailed descriptions of all `Decision Manager` response fields, see the *Decision Manager Developer Guide* in the Business Center.

[Data Type Definitions]

Request Fields {#sa-request-fields}
===================================

To prevent data tampering, sign all request fields except for fields that contain data the customer is entering.  
When signing fields in the request, create a comma-separated list of the fields. The sequence of the fields in the string is critical to the signature generation process. For example:

```
bill_to_forename=john
bill_to_surname=doe
bill_to_email=jdoe@example.com
signed_field_names=bill_to_forename,bill_to_surname,bill_to_email
```

When generating the security signature, create a comma-separated name=value string of the POST fields that are included in the signed_field_names field. The sequence of the fields in the string is critical to the signature generation process. For example:

* `bill_to_forename=john`
* `bill_to_surname=doe`
* `bill_to_email=jdoe@example.com`
  {#sa-request-fields_ul_j1c_sd4_lwb}  
  The string to sign is `bill_to_forename=john,bill_to_surname=doe,bill_to_email=jdoe@example.com`  
  For information on the signature generation process, see the security script of the sample code for the scripting language you are using. See [Scripting Language Samples](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-samples-scripting-languages.md "").  
  The TC 33 Capture file contains information about the purchases and refunds that a merchant submits to `Payment Gateway`. `Platform Connect` creates the TC 33 Capture file at the end of the day and sends it to the merchant's acquirer, who uses this information to facilitate end-of-day clearing processing with payment card companies.

Response Fields {#sa-response-fields}
=====================================

Response fields are sent using these notification methods:

* Merchant POST URL. See [Merchant Notifications](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-configuration/sa-merchant-notifications.md "").
* Merchant POST Email. See [Merchant Notifications](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-configuration/sa-merchant-notifications.md "").
* POST to the URL specified in the Transaction or Custom Cancel Response page. See [Customer Response Page](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-configuration/sa-customer-response-pg.md "").

Notification methods are enabled on the Notifications and Customer Response pages of your `Secure Acceptance` profile.  
To ensure the integrity of the response fields, a signature is included in the response. This signature is generated using the same secret_key value that was used to generate the request signature.  
To verify that the response fields have not been tampered with, create a signature using the fields listed in the signed_field_names response field. This signature must be the same value that is included in the signature response field. Refer to the receipt page that is included in the sample scripts. See [Scripting Language Samples](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-samples-scripting-languages.md "").

> Because response fields and reason codes can be added at any time, proceed as follows:
>
> * Parse the response data according to the names of the fields instead of their order in the response. For more information on parsing response fields, see the documentation for your scripting language.
> * The signature that you generate must be the same value that is included in the signature response field.
> * Your error handler should use the decision field to determine the transaction result if it receives a reason code that it does not recognize.
>   {#sa-response-fields_ul_uxy_hb3_15b}  
>   If configured, these response fields are sent back to your Merchant POST URL or email. See [Merchant Notifications](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-configuration/sa-merchant-notifications.md ""). Your error handler should use the decision field to obtain the transaction result if it receives a reason code that it does not recognize.  
>   The TC 33 Capture file contains information about the purchases and refunds that a merchant submits to Payment Gateway. `Platform Connect` creates the TC 33 Capture file at the end of the day and sends it to the merchant's acquirer, who uses this information to facilitate end-of-day clearing processing with payment card companies.

SEC Codes {#sa-sec-codes}
=========================

The echeck_sec_code field specifies the authorization method for the transaction. Possible values:

* `CCD:` corporate cash disbursement---a charge or credit against a business checking account. You can use one-time or recurring `CCD` transactions to transfer funds to or from a corporate entity. A standing authorization is required for recurring transactions. For `Payment Gateway ACH Service`, `CCD` is the default value for a credit when no value is set and when the echeck_account_type field is set to `X` or `G`.
* `PPD:` prearranged payment and deposit entry---a charge or credit against a personal checking or savings account. You can originate a `PPD` entry only when the payment and deposit terms between you and the customer are pre-arranged. A written authorization from the customer is required for one-time transactions, and a written standing authorization is required for recurring transactions. For `Payment Gateway ACH Service`, `PPD` is the default value for a debit when no value is set and when the echeck_account_type field is set to `C` or `S`.
* `TEL:` telephone-initiated entry---a one-time charge against a personal checking or savings account. You can originate a `TEL` entry only when there is a business relationship between you and the customer or when the customer initiates a telephone call to you. For a `TEL` entry, you must obtain a payment authorization from the customer over the telephone. Only the `Payment Gateway` ACH processor supports recurring telephone-initiated debits and credits. For `Payment Gateway ACH Service`, if the e-commerce indicator (ECI) for the Virtual Terminal is `MOTO`, the value of the echeck_sec_code field defaults to `TEL`.
* `WEB:` internet-initiated entry---a charge against a personal checking or savings account. You can originate a one-time or recurring `WEB` entry when the customer initiates the transaction over the internet. For a `WEB` entry, you must obtain payment authorization from the customer over the internet. For `Payment Gateway ACH Service`, if the ECI for the Virtual Terminal is not set to `MOTO`, the value of the echeck_sec_code field defaults to `WEB`. Use `WEB` as the SEC code for all Canadian dollar transactions on the `Chase Paymentech Solutions` connection.

[Types of Notifications]

AVS Codes {#sa-avs-codes}
=========================

An issuing bank uses the AVS code to confirm that your customer is providing the correct billing address. If the customer provides incorrect information, the transaction might be fraudulent. The international and U.S. domestic Address Verification Service (AVS) codes are the Relay standard AVS codes, except for codes 1 and 2, which are `Payment Gateway` AVS codes. The standard AVS return codes for other types of payment cards (including American Express cards) are mapped to the Relay standard codes. You receive the code in the auth_avs_code response field. See [Response Fields](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-wm-api-fields/sa-response-fields.md "").
When you populate billing street address 1 and billing street address 2, ` Platform Connect ` concatenates the two values. If the concatenated value exceeds 40 characters, ` Platform Connect ` truncates the value at 40 characters before sending it to Relay and the issuing bank. Truncating this value affects AVS results and therefore might also affect risk decisions and chargebacks.

International AVS Codes {#sa-international-avs-codes}
=====================================================

These codes are returned only for Relay cards issued outside the U.S.

Iframe Implementation {#sa-wm-iframe-implementation}
====================================================

> If you plan to embed ` Secure Acceptance ` in an iframe, ensure that you follow the guidelines in this section. PayPal Express Checkout is not supported on a ` Secure Acceptance ` iframe integration.
> For the Payer Authentication 3-D Secure 2.x process, ensure that the iframe is large enough to display the issuer's access control server (ACS) challenge content (at least 390 x 400 pixels). For more information about ACS, see the Payer Authentication guide.  
> Refer to [PCI DSS v4](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v4_0.pdf "") section 6.4.3 for more information on how to secure iframes.

Clickjacking Prevention {#sa-clickjacking-prevention}
=====================================================

Clickjacking (also known as [user-interface redress attack](# "") and [iframe overlay](# "")) is used by attackers to trick users into clicking on a transparent layer (with malicious code) above legitimate buttons or clickable content for a site. To prevent clickjacking, you must prevent third-party sites from including your website within an iframe.  
While no security remediation can prevent every clickjacking, developers must implement in accordance with relevant industry standards and guidelines, such as PCI DSS and Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) when using and securing iframes.  
You are required to implement the recommended prevention techniques in your website. For more information on PCI DSS and OWASP, see these websites:

* [PCI DSS v4](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v4_0.pdf "")

* [OWASP website](https://owasp.org "")

* [OWASP Clickjacking Defense Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet "")

* [OWASP Cross Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md "")  
  Web application protections for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) must also be incorporated.

* For XSS protection, you must implement comprehensive input validation and the OWASP-recommended security encoding library to do output encoding on your website.

* For CSRF protection, you are strongly encouraged to use a synchronized token pattern. This measure requires generating a randomized token associated with the user session. The token will be inserted whenever an HTTP request is sent to the server. Your server application will verify that the token from the request is the same as the one associated with the user session.

Iframe Transaction Endpoints {#sa-endpoints}
============================================

For iframe transaction endpoints and supported transaction types for each endpoint, see [Endpoints and Transaction Types](/docs/gateway/en-us/sa/developer/all/sa-checkout/secure-acceptance/sa-payment-txns/sa-endpoints-txn-types.md "").
