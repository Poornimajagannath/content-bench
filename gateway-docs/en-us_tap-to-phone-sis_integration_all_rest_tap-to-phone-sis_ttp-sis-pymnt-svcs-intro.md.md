Local Mode Payment Services {#ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-intro}
=======================================================

Use the information in this section to process payment services featured in the Acceptance Devices app when operated in Local mode.  
These are some Local mode features:

* The point-of-sale (POS) system communicates with the Acceptance Devices app on the Android device over a local Wi-Fi network.

* You can retrieve the Root CA certificate to validate the Acceptance Devices app server's certificate.

* You have the option to activate an mTLS connection in the Acceptance Devices app.
  {#ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-intro_ul_rts_tjh_bbc}  
  For information about other modes available in the Acceptance Devices app, see:

* [Cloud Mode Payment Services](/docs/gateway/en-us/tap-to-phone-sis/integration/all/rest/tap-to-phone-sis/ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-cloud-mode-intro.md "")

* [Standalone Mode Payment Services](/docs/gateway/en-us/tap-to-phone-sis/integration/all/rest/tap-to-phone-sis/ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-standalone-mode-intro.md "")

Communication Protocol Used in Local Mode {#ttp-sis-ad-app-comm-protocol}
=========================================================================

When using the solution in Local mode, the communication protocol used between the Acceptance Devices app and the point-of-sale (POS) system is a single WebSocket channel. Through this channel, simultaneous, two-way communication occurs between the Acceptance Devices app and the POS system.

Retrieving the Root CA Certificate {#ttp-sis-ad-app-retrieve-rootca-cert-intro}
===============================================================================

When the app is operating in Local mode, you can validate the Acceptance Devices app server's certificate by adding the Root CA certificate to your trust store. This action is required if you want to use an mTLS connection. For more information, see [Activating a Secure mTLS Connection](/docs/gateway/en-us/tap-to-phone-sis/integration/all/rest/tap-to-phone-sis/ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-intro/ttp-sis-activate-mtls-connection-intro.md "").  
Use the information in this section to retrieve the Root CA certificate in the `Business Center` or by using an API request.

Retrieve the Root CA Certificate in the `Business Center` {#ttp-sis-ad-app-retrieve-rootca-cert-ebc}
====================================================================================================

Follow these steps to retrieve the Root CA certificate in the Business Center:

1. In the `Business Center`, go to the left navigation panel and choose Acceptance Devices \&gt; Activation Codes. The Activation Codes page appears.
2. Click Download Root CA Certificate. When the download is complete, the browser window shows a download completion message.
3. In the local folder directory of your computer, navigate to the Download folder to access the Root CA certificate file.

Retrieve the Root CA Certificate Using a REST API Request {#ttp-sis-ad-app-retrieve-rootca-cert-task}
=====================================================================================================

You can use a REST API request to retrieve the Acceptance Devices app server's Root CA certificate when the app is operating in Local mode. You would then add the certificate to your trust store.  
You must authenticate each API request you send to a `Payment Gateway` API by using a REST shared secret key or a REST certificate. For more information about authentication requirements, see the [*Getting Started with REST Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/platform/developer/all/rest/rest-getting-started/restgs-intro.md "").

Activating a Secure mTLS Connection {#ttp-sis-activate-mtls-connection-intro}
=============================================================================

Use the information in this section to activate a secure Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) connection. When the app is operating in Local mode, using a mTLS connection creates an additional layer of security for communication between the Acceptance Devices app running on your Android device and point-of-sale (POS) system.  
Using the mTLS protocol is recommended because it employs two-way verification. The minimum requirement for providing end-to-end data security is using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  
Before activating an mTLS connection, you must retrieve the Root CA certificate. For more information, see [Retrieving the Root CA Certificate](/docs/gateway/en-us/tap-to-phone-sis/integration/all/rest/tap-to-phone-sis/ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-intro/ttp-sis-ad-app-retrieve-rootca-cert-intro.md "").

Endpoints
---------

The endpoint is the same for the test and production environments.  
**Test:** `POST https://{device IP address:port number}/ or wss://{device IP address:port number}/`  
**Production:** `POST https://{device IP address:port number}/ or wss://{device IP address:port number}/`

Generate a POS Connection Code for the Point-of-Sale System {#ttp-sis-activate-mtls-pos-setup-code}
===================================================================================================

Before you can sync your Android device with the point-of-sale (POS) system to establish a secure connection, you must activate the device. For more information, see [Activating an Android Device in the Acceptance Devices App](/docs/gateway/en-us/tap-to-phone-sis/integration/all/rest/tap-to-phone-sis/ttp-sis-get-started-intro/ttp-sis-ad-app-activate-terminal-intro.md ""). To ensure the security of the data sent over the internet between your POS system and Android device, you must establish a secure connection (sync) between your system and the device. You must complete this task one time for each POS system you are using.  
If Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) is enabled and the device activation is complete, the Generate Code screen appears in the Acceptance Devices app.  
Follow these steps to generate a POS connection code for a POS system in the Acceptance Devices app:

1. On the Generate Code screen, tap Generate Code.  
   ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/tap-to-phone-sis/images/ttp-sis-activate-secure-mtls-connect-1.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)
2. Record the eight-character code that appears on the screen. You will use this code to request a certificate from the POS system. The screen shows an expiration timer for the code, which refreshes every 300 seconds.  
   ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/tap-to-phone-sis/images/ttp-sis-activate-secure-mtls-connect-2.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)

Request Certificates for the Point-of-Sale System {#ttp-sis-activate-mtls-pos-setup-request-cert}
=================================================================================================

Before you can request certificates, you must generate a set-up code for the point-of-sale (POS) system. To finish activating the secure mTLS connection, request certificates for the POS system by sending a request to the Android device through the POS system.

1. On the Generate Code screen, tap the Details arrow. The Details section expands to show the HTTP and WSS (WebSocket) addresses and the port number.  
   ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/tap-to-phone-sis/images/ttp-sis-activate-secure-mtls-connect-3.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)
2. Record the HTTP and WSS addresses and port number shown in the Details section. You will use this information to request a certificate through the POS system, using the HTTPS or WSS address.
3. To request the certificates, send an API request through the POS system to the HTTP or WSS address and port number, along with the POS connection code shown on the Android device and a unique POS ID.
4. After the certificates are retrieved by the POS system and the sync between your POS system and Android device is complete, the *POS Activation Successful* message appears. Tap Close. The next set-up screen appears.  
   ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/tap-to-phone-sis/images/ttp-sis-activate-secure-mtls-connect-4.png/jcr:content/renditions/original)

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Your certificate response data appears here.
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Your certificate response data appears here.
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Your certificate response data appears here.
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Implement Hostname Validation in Local Mode {#ttp-sis-ad-app-implement-hostname-validate-intro}
===============================================================================================

When operating in Local mode, your app can optionally perform hostname validation for enhanced security. When the Android device is activated, a certificate is generated on the device. The certificate includes a Subject Alternative Name (SAN). This SAN appears as a Domain Name System (DNS) entry for the Acceptance Devices app server.  
This is the SAN format: `{terminal-serial-number}.pgw.seclib.io`.  
To enable hostname validation or connect to the Android device using the SAN instead of its IP address, update your system's `hosts` file to include both the terminal's IP address and its corresponding SAN.

Sale {#ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-sale-api-intro}

Stand-Alone Credit {#ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-standalone-credit-api-intro}
====================================================================

Use the information in this section to process a stand-alone credit when the app is in Local mode. This type of transaction is used to process a credit without reference to the original transaction. The customer is required to present their card for this type of transaction.

> WARNING
> When processing a stand-alone credit, there is no limit on the credit amount because there is no reference to the original transaction amount. The recommendation is to use a refund transaction whenever possible. For more information, see [Refund](/docs/gateway/en-us/tap-to-phone-sis/integration/all/rest/tap-to-phone-sis/ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-intro/ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-refund-api-intro.md "").

Pre-Authorization {#ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-pre-auth-api-intro}
==========================================================

Use the information in this section to process a pre-authorization for an initial amount in Local mode. A pre-authorization transaction places a temporary hold on the customer's payment card, which can be captured at a later time.  
Most authorizations expire in 5 to 7 days. The issuing bank sets the length of time before expiration. When an authorization expires with the issuing bank, your bank or processor might require you to re-submit an authorization request and include a request for capture in the same message. For more information, see [Capture](/docs/gateway/en-us/tap-to-phone-sis/integration/all/rest/tap-to-phone-sis/ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-intro/ttp-sis-pymnt-svcs-capture-api-intro.md "").
