eCheck Reconciliation Reporting Case Study {#echeck-reports-use-case}
=====================================================================

This case study shows an example of eight business days' worth of eCheck activity and how that activity appears on reconciliation reports.  
These reports are reconciliation reports:

* Funding Details Report

* Deposit Details Report

* Chargeback Details Report  
  The case study is written assuming that these things are true about the merchant account:

* Risk Reserve Target: $1,000.00

* Risk Reserve Rate: 10%

* Funding Hold Period: 3 days

* Monthly Transaction Volume Limit: $40,000.00

Day 1 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day1}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-01.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 1, the merchant processes four debit transactions totaling $9,900. The merchant does not process any credit transactions. Because of the 3-day funding hold, no money is moved to the reserve account. All money for day 1 is moved to the settlement account. No reconciliation reports are generated because nothing is funded yet.

Day 2 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day2}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-02.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 2, the merchant processes three debit transactions totaling $4,000 and no credit transactions. Because of the 3-day funding hold, no money is moved to the reserve account. All money for day 2 is moved to the settlement account. No reconciliation reports are generated because nothing is funded yet.

Day 3 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day3}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-03.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 3, the merchant processes one debit transaction totaling $2,000 and one credit transaction totaling $3,000. Because of the 3-day funding hold, no money is moved to the reserve account. All money for day 3 is moved to the settlement account. In this case, because there is $1,000 more credit than debit, $1,000 is removed from the settlement account. No reconciliation reports are generated because nothing is funded yet.

Day 4 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day4}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-04.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 4, the merchant processes three debit transactions totaling $7,000. The merchant does not process any credit transactions. Day 1 is now funded due to the lapse of the 3-day holding period. $990 is moved to the risk reserve account because the risk reserve rate is 10%, and the day 1 total was $9,900. The day 4 total is moved to the settlement account. $5,910 is funded. That amount reflects the settlement account balance, minus the debit totals for days 2, 3, and 4, minus the reserve amount ($990). Because funding occurred, reconciliation reports are generated for day 1 transactions and day 3 credit (there are no holds on credits).

Day 5 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day5}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-05.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 5, the merchant processes two debit transactions totaling $500, and one credit transaction totaling $5,000. $10 is moved to the risk reserve account, bringing the risk reserve account up to its full $1,000. The target funding amount is a negative amount (-$1,010), so nothing is funded on day 5. The settlement amount is -$4,500, so $4,500 is removed from the settlement account. No reconciliation reports are generated because nothing was funded.

Day 6 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day6}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-06.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 6, the merchant processes three debit transactions totaling $8,250 and credit transactions totaling $500. The sum of credit and debit transactions ($7,750) is moved to the settlement account. $490 is funded from days 2 and 3, based on the settlement account balance, minus the debit amounts for days 4, 5, and 6. Reconciliation reports are generated for day 2 and 3 transactions and day 5 and 6 credits.  
On day 6, the $40,000 monthly transaction limit is reached. Consequently, all funding and all credit transactions are put on hold until the following month or until the limit is raised.

Day 7 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day7}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-07.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 7, the merchant processes three debit transactions totaling $2,000 and no credit transactions. $2,000 is moved to the settlement account. $5,750 is funded from day 4, based on the settlement account balances, minus days 5 and 6, and day 7 debit amounts. Reconciliation reports are generated for day 4 transactions and day 7 credits.  
On day 7, a Chargeback Details Report is generated because two returns were sent back by payment processors. A debit for $1,500 was returned because of an incorrect account number, and a credit for $250 was returned because the account was closed. The reason codes listed in the chargeback details report are ACH return codes.

Day 8 {#echeck-reports-use-case-day8}
=====================================

![](/content/dam/new-documentation/documentation/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/echeck/user-guide/images/funding-scenario-day-08.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
On day 8, the merchant processes three debit transactions totaling $5,000 and no credit transactions. $5,000 is moved to the settlement account. $500 is funded from day 5 and $5,750 is re-deposited (because there was no account to which to move it), for a total deposit amount of $6,250.
