CARD Platform Connect: Specifications and Conditions for Resellers/Partners {#vpc-partner-reseller-disclaimer}
==============================================================================================================

The following are specifications and conditions that apply to a Reseller/Partner enabling its merchants through Payment Gateway for Platform Connect ("VPC") processing. Failure to meet any of the specifications and conditions below is subject to the liability provisions and indemnification obligations under Reseller/Partner's contract with Relay/Payment Gateway.

1. Before boarding merchants for payment processing on a VPC acquirer's connection, Reseller/Partner and the VPC acquirer must have a contract or other legal agreement that permits Reseller/Partner to enable its merchants to process payments with the acquirer through the dedicated VPC connection and/or traditional connection with such VPC acquirer.
2. Reseller/Partner is responsible for boarding and enabling its merchants in accordance with the terms of the contract or other legal agreement with the relevant VPC acquirer.
3. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that all considerations and fees associated with chargebacks, interchange downgrades, settlement issues, funding delays, and other processing related activities are strictly between Reseller and the relevant VPC acquirer.
4. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that the relevant VPC acquirer is responsible for payment processing issues, including but not limited to, transaction declines by network/issuer, decline rates, and interchange qualification, as may be agreed to or outlined in the contract or other legal agreement between Reseller/Partner and such VPC acquirer.

DISCLAIMER: NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS BY THE Platform Connect ACQUIRER IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS. NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR RESELLER/PARTNER BOARDING MERCHANTS OR ENABLING MERCHANT PROCESSING IN VIOLATION OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE RELEVANT Platform Connect ACQUIRER.

Introduction to Payments {#payments-intro}
==========================================

This introduction provides the basic information that you need to successfully process payment transactions. It also provides an overview of the payments industry and provides workflows for each process.  
With `Payment Gateway` payment services, you can process payment cards (tokenized or non-tokenized), digital payments such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, and customer ID transactions. You can process payments across the globe and across multiple channels with scalability and security. `Payment Gateway` supports a large number of payment cards and offers a wide choice of gateways and financial institutions, all through one connection.  
Visit the [`Payment Gateway` documentation hub](https://developer.example.com/docs.md "") to find additional processor-specific versions of this guide and additional technical documentation.

Financial Institutions and Payment Networks {#payments-intro-banks-overview}
============================================================================

Financial institutions and payment networks enable payment services to function. These entities work together to complete the full payment cycle.

Merchant Financial Institutions (Acquirers) {#payments-intro-banks-acquiring}
=============================================================================

A merchant financial institution, also known as an *acquirer*, offers accounts to businesses that accept payments. Before you can accept payments, you must have a merchant account from an acquirer. Your merchant account must be configured to process card-not-present or mail-order/telephone-order (MOTO) transactions.  
Each acquirer has connections to a limited number of payment processors. You must choose a payment processor that your acquirer supports.  
You can expect to pay these fees:

* Discount rates: your acquirer charges a fee and collects a percentage of every transaction. The combination of the fee and the percentage is called the *discount rate* . These charges can be *bundled* (combined into a single charge) or *unbundled* (charged separately).

* Interchange fees: payment networks, such as Relay or Mastercard, each have a base fee, called the *interchange fee*, for each type of transaction. Your acquirer and processor can show you ways to reduce this fee.

* Chargebacks: when cardholders dispute charges, you can incur *chargebacks*. A chargeback occurs when a charge on a customer's account is reversed. Your acquirer removes the money from your account and could charge you a fee for processing the chargeback.  
  Take these precautions to prevent chargebacks:

* Use accurate merchant descriptors so that customers can recognize the transactions on their statements.

* Provide good customer support.

* Ensure rapid problem resolution.

* Maintain a high level of customer satisfaction.

* Minimize fraudulent transactions.  
  If excessive chargebacks or fraudulent changes occur, these actions might be taken:

* You might be required to change your business processes to reduce the number chargebacks, fraud, or both.

* Your acquiring institution might increase your discount rate.

* Your acquiring institution might revoke your merchant account.  
  Contact your sales representative for information about products that can help prevent fraud.

Customer Financial Institutions (Issuers) {#payments-intro-banks-issuing}
=========================================================================

A customer financial institution, also known as an *issuer*, provides payment cards to and underwrites lines of credit for their customers. The issuer provides monthly statements and collects payments. The issuer must follow the rules of the payment card companies to which they belong.

Payment Networks {#payments-intro-card-companies}
=================================================

Payment networks manage communications between acquirers and issuing banks. They also develop industry standards, support their brands, and establish fees for acquiring institutions.  
Some payment networks, such as Relay and Mastercard, are trade associations that do not issue cards. Issuers are members of these associations, and they issue cards under license from the association.  
Other networks, such as Discover and American Express, issue their own cards. Before you process cards from these companies, you must sign agreements with them.

Payment Processors {#payments-intro-processors}
===============================================

Payment processors connect with acquirers. Before you can accept payments, you must register with a payment processor. An acquirer might require you to use a payment processor with an existing relationship with the acquirer.  
Your payment processor assigns one or more merchant IDs (MIDs) to your business. These unique codes identify your business during payment transactions.  
This table lists the processors and corresponding card types that are supported for payment services. IMPORTANT Only the card types explicitly listed here are supported.

  For a list of supported card types, see [Payment Processors](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-intro/payments-intro-banks-overview/payments-intro-processors.md "").

Co-Badged Cards {#payments-intro-cobadge-cards}
===============================================

Co-badged cards are credit and debit cards that integrate two or more payment networks.

mada Co-Badged Cards
--------------------

mada is Saudi Arabia's domestic payment network.  
These mada co-badged debit cards are supported:

* Relay and mada

* Mastercard and mada  
  mada co-badged debit cards are processed as follows:

* Only domestic processing is supported in Saudi Arabia.

* Transactions are sent directly to the Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority (SAMA) for processing.

* Payer authentication is supported. Relay Secure is supported for co-badged Relay and mada cards. Mastercard Identity Check is supported for co-badged Mastercard and mada cards.

* For acquirers, the card type is identified as MD.

* In reports, the card type is identified as either Relay or Mastercard.

* Dual-message processing is not supported. Only single-message processing is supported.

Co-Branded Cards {#payments-intro-cobrand-cards}
================================================

Co-branded cards are credit cards that are branded with a merchant's logo, brand, or other identifier as well as the payment network logo. These cards are not limited for use at the branded merchant and can be used at any merchant that accepts credit cards.

Credit Cards {#payments-intro-credit-cards}
===========================================

Cardholders use credit cards to borrow money from issuing banks to pay for goods and services offered by merchants that accept credit cards.

Debit Cards {#payments-intro-debit-cards}
=========================================

A debit card is linked to a cardholder's bank account. The funds are taken out of the customer's bank account, and the transaction is included on the customer's bank account statement. The customer does not receive a credit card bill as with a regular credit card.

Prepaid Cards {#payments-intro-prepaid-cards}
=============================================

Prepaid cards enable cardholders to pay for goods and services using money stored directly on the card.

Private Label Cards {#payments-intro-private-cards}
===================================================

Private label cards are issued by private companies. They enable cardholders to borrow money to pay for goods exclusively at the issuing company's stores.

Quasi-Cash {#payments-intro-cash-cards}
=======================================

Quasi-cash transactions involve instruments that are directly convertible to cash such as web wallets, travelers checks, cryptocurrency, and lottery tickets.

Transaction Types {#payments-intro-transactions-overview}
=========================================================

This topic provides information about transaction types that are supported by your processor.

Card-Not-Present Transactions {#payments-intro-transactions-card-not-present}
=============================================================================

When a customer provides a card number, but the card and the customer are not physically present at the merchant's location, the purchase is known as a *card-not-present transaction*. Typical card-not-present transactions are internet and phone transactions. Card-not-present transactions pose an additional level of risk to your business because the customer's identification cannot be verified. You can reduce that risk by using features such as the Address Verification System (AVS) and Card Verification Numbers (CVNs). The AVS and CVNs provide additional protection from fraud by verifying the validity of the customer's information and notifying you when discrepancies occur.

Card-Present Transactions {#payments-intro-transactions-card-present}
=====================================================================

When a customer uses a card that is physically present in a retail environment, the purchase is known as a *card-present transaction* . For information about card present transactions, see [*Card Present Connect \| Retail Integration Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/cp-retail/integration/ctv/rest/cp-retail/cp-intro-cpc.md "") and [*Card Present Connect \| Mass Transit Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/urban-mobility/developer/ctv/rest/mass-transit/um-intro-overview.md "") .

Authorizations with Card Verification Numbers {#payments-auth-cvn-intro}
========================================================================

Card verification numbers (CVNs) are a required feature for the authorization service.  
The CVN is printed on a payment card, and only the cardholder can access it. The CVN is used in card-not-present transactions as a verification feature. Using the CVN helps reduce the risk of fraud.  
CVNs are not included in payment card track data and cannot be obtained from a card swipe, tap, or dip.  
CVNs must not be stored after authorization.  
IMPORTANT In Europe, Relay mandates that you not include a CVN for mail-order transactions and not record a CVN on any physical format such as a mail-order form.

CVN Locations and Terminology {#payments-auth-cvn-locations}
============================================================

For most cards, the CVN is a three-digit number printed on the back of the card, to the right of the signature field. For American Express, the CVN is a four-digit number printed on the front of the card above the card number.

#### Figure:

CVN Locations ![Image depicting the location of the CVN on the back of most cards and the front
of an American Express card.](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/payments/images/CVV_Location.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
Each payment card company has its own name for the CVN value:

* Mastercard calls it the *card validation code* (CVC2).
* Relay calls it the *card verification value* (CVV2).

International Transactions {#payments-intro-transactions-intl}
==============================================================

Consider compliance and merchant remittance funding when processing international transactions.

Compliance {#payments-intro-compliance}
=======================================

Accepting payments from a country other than your own requires that you observe the processing rules and practices of the payment systems in that country. This list describes areas of compliance that are especially important:

* Merchant descriptor requirements---A merchant descriptor communicates merchant information to customers to remind them of the circumstances that triggered a payment. Merchant descriptors reduce the possibility of a chargeback. Accordingly, the merchant descriptor displayed on a customer's statement should be a close match to the name on your website. It is not good practice to consolidate multiple websites into a single merchant account and use a generic descriptor that more-or-less covers all offerings.
* Excessive chargebacks---To prevent an excessive number of chargebacks, you must maintain good customer support, rapid problem resolution, a high level of customer satisfaction, and transaction management processes that minimize fraudulent transactions. When payment card chargebacks become excessive, you must change business processes to reduce chargebacks. If chargebacks are not reduced to a satisfactory level, your account can be terminated.

Merchant Remittance Funding {#payments-intro-transactions-intl-remittance}
==========================================================================

You can request that the transaction proceeds be converted to another currency. Currency conversion uses a foreign exchange rate to calculate the conversion to the requested currency. The foreign exchange rate might be explicitly stated as a rate or implicitly stated as a transaction amount. The funded amount and can vary from day to day. The foreign exchange rate might also include an increase for the foreign exchange risk, sales commissions, and handling costs.

Payment Services {#payments-services-intro}
===========================================

Various services are involved in processing payments.  
These services enable customers to purchase goods and services. They also enable merchants to receive payments from customer accounts, to provide refunds, and to void transactions.

Authorization {#payments-intro-processing-auth}
===============================================

An authorization confirms that a payment card account holds enough funds to pay for a purchase. Authorizations can be made online or offline.

Online Authorization {#payments-intro-processing-auth-online}
=============================================================

Online authorizations provide immediate confirmation of funds availability. The customer's financial institution also reduces the amount of credit available in the customer's account, setting aside the authorized funds for the merchant to capture at a later time. Authorizations for most payment cards are processed online. Typically, it is safe to start fulfilling the order when you receive an authorization confirmation.  
An online authorization confirmation and the subsequent hold on funds expire after a specific length of time. Therefore it is important to capture funds in a timely manner. The issuing bank sets the expiration time interval, but most authorizations expire within 5 to 7 days.  
The issuing bank does not inform `Payment Gateway` when an authorization confirmation expires. By default, the authorization information for each transaction remains in the `Payment Gateway` database for 180 days after the authorization date. To capture an authorization that expired with the issuing bank, you can resubmit the authorization request.

Offline Authorization {#payments-intro-processing-auth-offline}
===============================================================

Online transactions require an internet connection. In situations where the internet is not available, for example, due to an outage, merchants can continue to take credit card payments using offline transactions. An offline authorization is an authorization request for which you do not receive an immediate confirmation about the availability of funds.  
Offline authorizations have a higher level of risk than online transactions because they do not confirm funds availability or set aside the funds for later capture. Further, it can take up to 5 days to receive payment confirmations for offline transactions. To mitigate this risk, merchants may choose to fulfill orders only after receiving payment confirmation.

Incremental Authorization {#payments-intro-processing-auth-incremental}
=======================================================================

Incremental authorizations are useful when a customer adds products and services to a purchase. After a successful initial authorization, you can request subsequent authorizations and request one capture for the initial authorization and the incremental authorizations.  
The incremental authorization service is not the same as the incremental authorization scenario for a merchant-initiated transaction.

Scenario for an Incremental Authorization {#payments-processing-basic-auth-inc-scenario}
========================================================================================

This sequence is an example of how incremental authorizations work:

1. The customer reserves a hotel room for two nights at a cost of 200.00 per night. You request an authorization for 400.00. The authorization request is approved.
2. The customer orders dinner through room service the first night. You request an incremental authorization of 50.00 for the dinner.
3. The customer decides to stay an extra night. You request an incremental authorization of 200.00 for the additional night.
4. The customer uses items from the mini-bar. The cost of the mini-bar items is 50.00. You request an incremental authorization of 50.00.
5. When the customer checks out, they sign a receipt for 700.00, which is the total of all costs incurred.
6. You request a capture for 700.00.

Pre-Authorization {#payments-intro-pre-auths}
=============================================

A pre-authorization enables you to authorize a payment when the final amount is unknown. The system places the funds on hold until you request a follow-up transaction. Pre-authorizations are typically used for lodging, auto rental, e-commerce, and restaurant transactions.
IMPORTANT Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) rules in the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) require the initial pre-authorization to use strong customer authentication for merchants or customers in PSD2-applicable countries.  
When you have a specific merchant category code (MCC) assigned to your account, you are allowed to capture up to 20% more than the cumulatively authorized amount on Relay, Diners Club, Discover, and JCB cards. Contact your account manager to have your account enabled for this option.  
For a pre-authorization:

* The authorization amount is greater than zero.
* Submit the authorization for capture within 30 calendar days of its request.
* When you do not capture the authorization, reverse it.  
  In the US, Canada, Latin America, and Asia Pacific, Mastercard charges an additional fee for a pre-authorization that is not captured and not reversed.  
  In Europe, Russia, Middle East, and Africa, Mastercard charges fees for all pre-authorizations.
* Chargeback protection is in effect for 30 days after the authorization.

Payment Network Token Authorization {#payments-intro-processing-auth-pnt}
=========================================================================

You can integrate authorizations with payment network tokens into your existing order management system. For an incremental authorization, you do not need to include any payment network tokenization fields in the authorization request because `Payment Gateway` obtains the payment network tokenization information from the original authorization request.

Authorization Workflow {#payments-intro-processing-auth-workflow}
=================================================================

This image and description show the authorization workflow:  
![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/payments/images/Authorization2.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The customer purchases goods or services from the merchant using a payment card.
2. You send an authorization request over secure internet connection to `Payment Gateway`. When the customer buys a digitally delivered product or service, you can request both the authorization and the capture at the same time. When the customer buys a physically fulfilled product, do not request the capture until you ship the product.
3. `Payment Gateway` validates the order information then contacts your payment processor and requests authorization.
4. The processor sends the transaction to the payment card company, which routes it to the issuing bank for the customer's payment card. Some card companies, including Discover and American Express, act as their own issuing banks.
5. The issuing bank approves or declines the request.
   * If funds are available, the issuing bank reserves the amount of the authorization request and returns an authorization approval to `Payment Gateway`.
   * If the issuing bank denies the request, it returns an authorization denial to `Payment Gateway`.
     {#payments-intro-processing-auth-workflow_ul_smg_gg5_rbc}
6. `Payment Gateway` runs its own tests then tells you whether the authorization succeeded.

Sale {#payments-intro-processing-sales}
=======================================

A sale is a bundled authorization and capture. Some processors and acquirers require a sale transaction instead of using separate authorization and capture requests. For other processors and acquirers, you can request a sale instead of a separate authorization and capture when you provide the goods or services immediately after taking an order.  
There are two types of sale processing: dual-message processing and single-message processing.

Dual-Message Processing {#payments-intro-processing-sales-dual}
===============================================================

Dual-message processing is a two-step process. The authorization is processed first. If the authorization is successful, the capture is processed immediately afterward. The response includes the authorization and the capture information. If the authorization is declined, the capture is not processed, and the response message includes only the authorization information.

Partial Authorizations {#payments-intro-processing-sales-dual-partialauth}
==========================================================================

All debit and prepaid card processors as well as a limited number of credit card processors support partial authorizations when dual-message processing is in place.  
When partial authorization is enabled, the issuing financial institution can approve a partial amount when the balance on the card is less than the requested amount. When a partial amount is authorized, the capture is not processed. The merchant can then use a second card to cover the balance, adjust the total cost, or void the transaction.

Single-Message Processing {#payments-intro-processing-sales-single}
===================================================================

Single-message processing treats the authorization and capture as a single transaction. There are important differences between dual-message processing and single-message processing:

* Single-message processing treats the request as a full-financial transaction, and with a successful transaction, funds are immediately transferred from the customer account to the merchant account.
* Authorization and capture amounts must be the same.
* Some features cannot be used with single-message processing.

Authorization Reversal {#payments-intro-processing-reversal}
============================================================

The authorization reversal service releases the hold that an authorization placed on a customer's payment card funds.  
Each card-issuing financial institution has its own rules for deciding whether an authorization reversal succeeds or fails. When a reversal fails, contact the card-issuing financial institution to learn whether there is a different way to reverse the authorization.  
If your processor supports authorization reversal after void (ARAV), you can reverse an authorization after you void the associated capture. If your processor does not support ARAV, you can use the authorization reversal service only for an authorization that has not been captured and settled.  
An authorization reversal is a follow-on transaction that uses the request ID returned from an authorization. The main purpose of a follow-on transaction is to link two transactions. The request ID links the follow-on transaction to the original transaction. The authorization request ID is used to look up the customer's billing and account information in the `Payment Gateway` database. You are not required to include those fields in the full authorization reversal request. The original transaction and follow-on transaction are linked in the database and in the `Business Center`.  
For processors that support debit cards and prepaid cards, the full authorization reversal service works for debit cards and prepaid cards in addition to credit cards.

> IMPORTANT
> You cannot perform an authorization reversal if a transaction is in a review state, which can occur if you use a fraud management service. You must reject the transaction prior to authorization reversal. For more information, see the fraud management documentation in the ` Business Center `.

Automatic Partial Authorization Reversal {#payments-auth-reversal-automatic-partial-overview}
=============================================================================================

Automatic partial authorization reversals are supported for:

* Credit cards
* Debit cards and prepaid cards.
* Quasi-cash.

If the capture amount is less than the authorization amount, `Payment Gateway` automatically performs a partial authorization reversal before it sends the capture request to the processor. The results of a successful partial authorization reversal are:

* The capture amount matches the new authorization amount at the payment card company.
* The hold on the unused credit card funds might be released. The issuing bank decides whether or not to release the hold on unused funds.  
  Not all issuers act on a request for a partial authorization reversal. Therefore, `Payment Gateway` cannot guarantee that the funds will be released.

Capture {#payments-intro-processing-capture}
============================================

A capture is a follow-on transaction to an authorization. It is used to transfer the authorized funds from the customer's account to the merchant account. To link the authorization transaction to the capture transaction, you include a request ID in your capture request. This request ID is returned to you in the authorization response.  
Captures are typically not performed in real time. They are placed in a batch file and sent to the processor, and the processor settles all of the captures at one time. In most cases, these batch files are sent and processed outside of the merchant's business hours. It usually takes 2 to 4 days for the acquiring financial institution to deposit the funds into the merchant account.  
When fulfilling only part of a customer's order, do not capture the full amount of the authorization. Capture only the cost of the delivered items. When you deliver the remaining items, request a new authorization, and then capture the new authorization.

> IMPORTANT
> It is not possible to perform a capture if a transaction is in a review state, which can occur if you use a fraud management service. You must accept the transaction prior to capture. For more information, see the fraud management documentation in the ` Business Center `.

Capture Workflow {#payments-intro-processing-capture-workflow}
==============================================================

The capture workflow begins when you send a request for a capture.  
![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/payments/images/payments-capture-flow-660x225.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The merchant sends a request for a capture to the `Payment Gateway` gateway.
2. For online captures, `Payment Gateway` validates the order information then sends an online capture to the payment processor. For offline captures, `Payment Gateway` stores the capture request in a batch file and sends the batch file to the payment processor after midnight.
3. The processor validates the request and forwards it to the issuing bank.
4. The issuing bank transfers funds to the acquiring bank.

> IMPORTANT
> The payment processor does not notify ` Payment Gateway ` that the money has been transferred. To ensure that all captures are processed correctly, you should reconcile your capture requests with the capture reports from your processor.

Refund {#payments-intro-processing-credit}
==========================================

Refunds are payment refunds from a merchant to the cardholder after a cardholder pays for a product or service and that payment is captured by the merchant. When a refund request is successful, the issuer transfers funds from the merchant bank (acquirer) account to the customer's account. It typically takes 2 to 4 days for the acquirer to transfer funds from your merchant account.  
There are two types of refunds: a *follow-on refund* that is linked to an original capture or sale, and a *stand-alone credit* that is not linked to an original capture or sale.

> WARNING
> You should carefully control access to your refund and credit services. Do not request this service directly from your customer interface. Instead, incorporate this service as part of your customer service process. This process reduces the potential for fraudulent transactions.

Follow-on Refund
----------------

Refunds, also known as *follow-on refunds*, use the capture request ID to link the refund to the original transaction. This request ID is returned during the capture request (also known as a *settlement*) and is used in all subsequent refunds associated with the original capture. The request ID links the transaction to the customer's billing and account information, so you are not required to include those fields in the refund request.
When you combine a request for a refund with a request for another service, such as the tax calculation service, you must provide the customer's billing and account information.  
Unless otherwise specified, refunds must be requested within 180 days of a settlement. You can request multiple follow-on refunds against a single capture or sale transaction as long as the total amount does not exceed the original purchase amount. To perform multiple follow-on refunds, use the same request ID in each request.

Stand-Alone Credits
-------------------

Stand-alone credits are not connected to an original transaction. Stand-alone credits do not have a time restriction, and they can be used to issue refunds more than 180 days after a transaction settlement.

Refund and Credit Workflow {#payments-intro-processing-credit-workflow}
=======================================================================

This workflow applies to follow-on credits, also known as refunds, and stand-alone credits. It begins when you send a request for a refund or credit.  
Refunds and credits do not happen in real time. All of the credit requests for a day are typically placed in a file and sent to the processor as a single *batch* transaction. In most cases, the batch transaction is settled overnight.  
![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/payments/images/payments-credit-660x225.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. The merchant sends the refund or credit request to `Payment Gateway`.
2. For online refunds and credits, `Payment Gateway` validates the order information then sends the request to the payment processor. For offline refunds and credits, `Payment Gateway` stores the request in a batch file and sends the batch file to the payment processor after midnight.
3. The processor validates the request and forwards it to the acquiring bank.
4. The acquiring bank transfers funds to the issuing bank.

IMPORTANT Not all processors support stand-alone credits.

Void {#payments-intro-processing-void}
======================================

A void cancels a capture or credit request that you submitted to `Payment Gateway` but has not already been submitted to your processor. Capture and credit requests are usually submitted to your processor once a day, so your window for successfully voiding a capture or credit request is small. A void request is declined when the capture or credit request has already been sent to the processor.  
After a void is processed, you cannot credit or capture the funds. You must perform a new transaction to capture or credit the funds. Further, when you void a capture, a hold remains on the authorized funds. If you are not going to re-capture the authorization, and if your processor supports authorization reversal after void (ARAV), you should request an authorization reversal to release the hold on the unused funds.  
A void uses the capture or credit request ID to link the transactions. The authorization request ID is used to look up the customer's billing and account information, so there is no need to include those fields in the void request. You cannot perform a follow-on credit against a capture that has been voided.

Payment Features {#payments-features-intro}
===========================================

You can apply features to different payment services to enhance the customer payment processing experience. This section includes an overview of these features:

* [Debit and Prepaid Card Payments](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-intro/payments-features-intro/payments-debit-prepaid-intro.md "")

* [Token Management Service](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-intro/payments-features-intro/payment-tms-intro.md "")

Debit and Prepaid Card Payments {#payments-debit-prepaid-intro}
===============================================================

Debit cards are linked to a cardholder's checking account. The funds are taken out of the customer's bank account, and the transaction is included on the customer's bank account statement. The customer does not receive a credit card bill as with a regular credit card.  
You can process debit cards using these services:

* Credit card services
* PIN debit services
* Partial authorizations, which are a special feature available for debit cards
* Balance inquiries, which are a special feature available for debit cards

Requirements
------------

In Canada, to process domestic debit transactions on `Platform Connect` with Mastercard, you must contact customer support to have your account configured for this feature.  
See [Standard Payment Processing](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-processing-basic-intro.md "") for information that shows you how to use credit card services.  
See [Debit and Prepaid Card Processing](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-debit-prepaid-process-intro.md "") for information that shows you how to process authorizations that use a debit or prepaid card.

Interchange Optimization {#payments-interchange-optimization}
=============================================================

Interchange fees are per-transaction transfer fees charged by your acquirer. The fee amount is based in part on the transaction amount that the acquirer submits to the payment network for clearing and settlement. Interchange optimization can help to reduce these fees for card-present transactions.  
See [Merchant Financial Institutions (Acquirers)](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-intro/payments-intro-banks-overview/payments-intro-banks-acquiring.md "") for information about acquirers.

Payment Cards Supported with Interchange Optimization
-----------------------------------------------------

* Mastercard
* Relay
  {#payments-interchange-optimization_ul_lww_wyw_rxb}

Automatic Authorizations
------------------------

Interchange optimization works by automatically performing additional authorization transactions for two types of card-not-present scenarios.

Automatic Authorization Refresh
:
If a capture request occurs more than 6 days after the date of the original authorization, the processor automatically obtains a fresh authorization for the capture amount.

Automatic Partial Authorization Reversal
:
If the capture does not need a fresh authorization but the capture amount is less than the authorization amount, the processor automatically performs a partial authorization reversal. The reversal releases the hold on unused credit card funds and ensures that the settlement amount matches the authorization amount.

How Interchange Optimization Transactions are Tracked
-----------------------------------------------------

To find out when the processor performed automatic authorizations, see the daily processor report.

Limitations
-----------

* Interchange optimization does not apply to transactions in which the payment card is present at the merchant's physical place of business.
* Interchange optimization is not supported with incremental authorizations.
  {#payments-interchange-optimization_ul_xg1_zyw_rxb}

Requirement
-----------

Contact customer support to enable interchange optimization for your account.

Japanese Payment Options {#payments-jpo}
========================================

Japanese payment options (JPO) extend the `Payment Gateway` payment card processing features to support payment methods used only in Japan. Japanese issuers, cardholders, merchants, and acquirers recognize payment methods that clarify the nature of a payment. JPO provides for more fine-grained identification of one-time payments and installment payments. You can offer your customers JPO payment methods that they select at the time of purchase.  
JPO supports these payment methods:

* Single payment
* Bonus payment
* Installment payment
* Revolving payment
* Combination of bonus payment and installment payment
  IMPORTANT Requests with Japanese payment options are accepted independently of your agreements with acquirers. When you submit a request with one of these payment options but do not have the necessary contracts and agreements in place, an error might not occur until the acquirer processes the settlement file.  
  For more information about the Japanese payment options, contact Customer Support of `Payment Gateway` KK (Japan).  
  See [Japanese Payment Options Processing](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-jpo-intro.md "") for information that shows you how to process payments using JPO.

Payment Cards Supported with JPO
--------------------------------

JPO is supported for the Sumitomo Mitsui Card Co. acquirer with transactions that use Relay payment cards issued in Japan.

Services Supported with JPO
---------------------------

Authorization service.

Requirements {#payments-jpo_jpo-process-prereq}
-----------------------------------------------

* You have signed a contract with your acquirer.
* You have contacted your account provider for details about contracts and funding cycles. The funding cycle could differ when using JPO.
* Card holders who want to use JPO have signed a contract with an issuing bank.
* You have confirmed payment option availability with your account provider and card holder before implementing one of these payment options.

Micropayments {#payments-micro}
===============================

**Services:**

* Authorization
* Capture
* Refund

*Micropayments* are payments for less than one unit in the transaction's currency.

Mastercard Bill Payments {#payments-mc-bill-pay}
================================================

In Brazil, you can participate in a Mastercard Bill Payment program. If your account is enrolled in the program, your customers can use their Mastercard payment cards to make payments on their outstanding bills. IMPORTANT A Mastercard card payment at the point of sale (POS) when goods or services are purchased is not part of the Mastercard Bill Payment program.  
When you send an authorization request for a Mastercard Bill Payment, include the API field that specifies the bill payment type.  
See [Mastercard Bill Payment Processing](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-processing-mastercard-intro/payments-mc-bill-pay-intro.md "") for information that shows you how to process Mastercard Bill Payments.

Limitation
----------

The Mastercard Bill Payment program supports only bills paid in Brazil using Mastercard payments cards with `Platform Connect`.

Requirements {#payments-mc-bill-pay_mc-billpay-process-prereq}
--------------------------------------------------------------

Sign up with Mastercard to participate in their bill payment program.

Mastercard Expert Monitoring Solutions {#payments-mc-ems}
=========================================================

Mastercard Expert Monitoring Solutions provides a predictive, behavior-based fraud score in real time during authorizations for card-not-present transactions. The score indicates the likelihood that the requested transaction is fraudulent and the type of fraud that is suspected.  
To assign the fraud score for a transaction, Mastercard compares the customer's transaction data to their transaction behavior history and to a regional card-not-present fraud detection model. The resulting score is returned in the body of the response message.

Limitations
-----------

This feature is supported on Mastercard Payment cards issued in the US only.  
See [Mastercard Expert Monitoring Solutions Processing](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-processing-mastercard-intro/payments-mc-ems-intro.md "") for information that shows you how to obtain the transaction fraud score determined by Mastercard Expert Monitoring Solutions.

Requirement {#payments-mc-ems_mc-ems-process-prereq}
----------------------------------------------------

Contact customer support to enable Mastercard Expert Monitoring Solutions for your account. IMPORTANT After this feature is enabled for your account, Mastercard returns a fraud score for all your card-not-present authorization requests for Mastercard payment cards issued in the US.

Payer Authentication {#payments-processing-pa-intro}
====================================================

Payer authentication is run before a transaction is submitted for authorization. Most of the time payer authentication is bundled with authorization so that after payer authentication happens, the transaction is automatically submitted for authorization. Payer authentication and authorization can be configured to occur as separate operations. This section shows you how to run payer authentication as a separate process and pass the payer authentication data when seeking authorization for a transaction.  
Payer authentication consists of a two-step verification process that adds an extra layer of fraud protection during the payment process. During transactions, the transaction device, location, past purchasing habits, and other factors are analyzed for indications of fraud. This process collects customer data during the transaction from at least two of these three categories:

* **Something you have**: A payment card or a payment card number
* **Something you know**: A password or pin
* **Something you are**: Facial recognition or fingerprint

Each of these payment card companies has its own payer authentication product:

* **American Express**: SafeKey
* **Discover**: ProtectBuy
* **JCB**: J/Secure
* **Mastercard**: Identity Check
* **Relay**: Relay Secure

Payer authentication can be used to satisfy the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirement of the Payment Services Directive (PSD2). SCA applies to the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom. SCA requires banks to perform additional checks when customers make payments to confirm their identity.  
See [Payer Authentication Processing](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-processing-pa-process-intro.md "") for information about how to process payments with payer authentication.

Relaxed Requirements for Address Data and Expiration Date in Payment Transactions {#payments-relax-reqs-intro}
==============================================================================================================

With relaxed requirements for address data and the expiration date, not all standard payment request fields are required. It is your responsibility to determine whether your account is enabled to use this feature and which fields are required.  
See [Relaxed Requirements for Address Data and Expiration Date in a Payment](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-relax-reqs.md "") for information about how to process payments with relaxed requirements for address data and expiration date.

Split Shipment {#payments-split-ship-intro}
===========================================

Split shipments enable you to split an order into multiple shipments with multiple captures. You can use this feature when a customer orders a product that is not yet available, or when one or some products are available but not all. You are able to request multiple partial captures for one authorization, multiple authorizations and one capture, or an authorization and a sale.  
`Payment Gateway` provides the split shipment services for authorizations and captures. There are three scenarios and actions you can take:

* Multiple authorizations---Request more than one authorizations; when the order is placed for the unavailable product and after the product becomes available to ship.
* Multiple partial captures---Request an authorization, and then request multiple partial captures for the amount of the products you ship. When the remaining product becomes available, ship it and request another capture.
* Multiple authorizations with multiple partial captures---Request more than one authorizations and captures when all the products in the order are not available for immediate shipment. After the other products become available, request another authorization, and then a capture when you ship the remaining product.

How Split Shipments Transactions are Linked
-------------------------------------------

All transactions for a split shipment are linked together in the `Business Center` and in reports. When you split an order into multiple shipments with multiple partial captures, `Payment Gateway` requests the additional authorizations for you.

Obtaining the Status of a System-Generated Authorization
--------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT A system-generated authorization is not performed in real time. The response message that you receive indicates that the request was received, not whether it was approved or declined.  
A system-generated authorization can be declined for the same reasons that a regular authorization can be declined. `Payment Gateway` recommends you use one of following methods to obtain the status of the system-generated authorization request before shipping the product:

* `Business Center`---Use the capture request ID to search for the follow-on capture. The details for all related transactions are displayed on the **Transaction Details** page. It can take a maximum of 6 hours for the status of the system-generated authorization request to be available.
* Transaction Detail API---You must use version 1.3 or later of the report and include the parameter includeExtendedDetail in your query. It can take a maximum of 6 hours for the status of the system-generated authorization request to be available.
* Transaction Exception Detail Report---`Payment Gateway` recommends you use this report on a daily basis to identify transactions that were declined.

Additional Authorizations {#payments-split-ship-intro_section_zdn_ssn_xwb}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you need an additional authorization for an order, you can use the link-to-request field to link follow-on authorizations to the original authorization in addition to the basic fields required for every authorization request. The follow-on authorization is linked to the original authorization in the `Business Center` and in reports. The captures for these authorizations are also linked to the original authorization in the `Business Center` and in reports.  
For an additional authorization on a processor that supports merchant-initiated transactions, the authorization request must include the subsequent authorization fields that are required for merchant-initiated transactions.

Additional Captures {#payments-split-ship-intro_section_a2n_ssn_xwb}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When you need an additional capture for an order, `Payment Gateway` performs a system-generated authorization for additional capture requests using the payment data from the original authorization. The system-generated authorization is linked to the original authorization in the `Business Center` and in reports. The captures are linked to the authorizations in the `Business Center` and in reports through the request IDs as with any capture.  
See [Authorizing a Sale for a Product Not Yet Available](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-processing-basic-split-ship-intro/payments-processing-basic-split-ship-one-auth-sale.md "") for guidelines on how to process a payment when a product is not available. See [Processing an Authorization and Two Captures for Multiple Products](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-processing-basic-split-ship-intro/payments-processing-basic-split-ship-one-auth-two-.md "") or [Processing Two Authorizations and a Capture for Multiple Products](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-processing-basic-split-ship-intro/payments-processing-basic-split-ship-two-auth-cap-.md "") for guidelines on how to process payments for multiple products.

Token Management Service {#payment-tms-intro}
=============================================

The `Token Management Service` (`TMS`) enables you to replace personally identifiable information (PII), such as the primary account numbers (PANs), with unique tokens. These tokens do not include the PII data, but act as a placeholder for the personal information that would otherwise need to be shared. By using tokens, businesses can provide a secure payment experience, reduce the risk of fraud, and comply with industry consumer security regulations such as PCI-DSS.  
`TMS` links tokens across service providers, payment types, and channels for sellers, acquirers, and technology partners. `TMS` tokenizes, securely stores, and manages the primary account number (PAN), the payment card expiration date, electronic check details, and customer data. `TMS` also enables you to create a network token of a customer's payment card.
IMPORTANT Due to mandates from the Reserve Bank of India, merchants based in India cannot store PANs. Use network tokens instead.  
You can manage sensitive data securely by creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tokens through the [TMS API](https://developer.example.com/api-reference-assets/index.md#token-management "").  
`TMS` simplifies your PCI DSS compliance. `TMS` passes tokens back to you that represent this data. You then store these tokens in your environment and databases instead of storing customer payment details.  
`TMS` protects sensitive payment information through tokenization and secures and manages customer data using these token types:

* Customer tokens
* Instrument identifier tokens
* Payment instrument tokens
* Shipping address tokens

These `TMS` tokens can be used individually, or they can be associated with one customer token:

#### Figure:

`TMS` Token Types  
![Diagram of the unified token identifier.](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/payment-services/tms/images/token-types-intro-600x400.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original) For detailed information about `TMS`, see [*`Token Management Service` Developer Guide*](https://developer.example.com/docs/gateway/en-us/tms/developer/ctv/rest/tms/tms-overview.md "").

Testing the Payment Services {#payments-testing-services}
=========================================================

To ensure that requests are processed correctly, you must test the basic success and error conditions for each service you plan to use.

Requirements for Testing {#payments-testing-requirements}
=========================================================

Before you can test, contact customer support to activate the credit card services and configure your account for testing. You must also contact your processor to set up your processor account.

> IMPORTANT
> When building your connection to the ` Payment Gateway ` payment gateway, ensure that you have implemented controls to prevent card testing or card enumeration attacks on your platform. For more information, see the [best practices guide](https://www.example.com/content/dam/documents/en/payment-card-testing-bot-attacks.pdf ""). When we detect suspicious transaction activity associated with your merchant ID, including a card testing or card enumeration attack, ` Payment Gateway ` reserves the right to enable fraud management tools on your behalf in order to mitigate the attack. The fraud team might also implement internal controls to mitigate attack activity. These controls block traffic that is perceived as fraudulent. Additionally, if you are using one of our fraud tools and experience a significant attack, our internal team might modify or add rules to your configuration to help prevent the attack and minimize the threat to our infrastructure. However, any actions taken by ` Payment Gateway ` would not replace the need for you to follow industry standard best practices to protect your systems, servers, and platforms.  
> Follow these requirements when you test your system:

* Use your regular merchant ID.
* Use a real combination for the city, state, and postal code.
* Use a real combination for the area code and telephone number.
* Use a nonexistent account and domain name for the customer's email address.
* REST API test endpoint: `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/pts/v2/payments`{#payments-testing-requirements_restauth-test}

Test Card Numbers {#payments-testing-cards}
===========================================

Use these payment card numbers to test the authorization, capture, and credit services. Remove the spaces from the test card numbers when sending them to the test system. Do not use real payment card numbers. To test card types that are not included in the list, use an account number that is in the card's BIN range. For best results, try each test with a different service request and with different test payment card numbers.

> IMPORTANT The test card numbers that are provided are formatted with Xs for zeroes in the card number. When testing with these card numbers, remove the spaces and replace each X with a 0 (zero).

* American Express---3782 8224 631X XX5
* Discover---6X11 1111 1111 1117
* Jaywan---669X 1XXX XXXX XXXX

    {#payments-testing-cards_ul_3}
* Relay---4111 1111 1111 1111

Using Amounts to Simulate Errors {#payments-testing-amounts}
============================================================

You can simulate error messages by requesting authorization, capture, or credit services with specific amounts that trigger the error messages. These triggers work only on the test server, not on the production server.  
Each payment processor uses its own error messages. For more information, see: [REST API Testing Guide](https://developer.example.com/hello-world/testing-guide.md "")

Test American Express Card Verification {#payments-testing-amex}
================================================================

Before using CVN with American Express, it is strongly recommended that you follow these steps:

1. Contact customer support to have your account configured for CVN. Until you do this, you will receive a `1` in the processorInformation.cardVerification.resultCode response field.
2. Test your system in production using a small currency amount, such as one currency unit. Instead of using the test account numbers, use a real payment card account number, and send an incorrect CVN in the request for authorization. The card should be refused and the request declined.

Standard Payment Processing {#payments-processing-basic-intro}
==============================================================

This section shows you how to process various authorization, capture, credit, and sales transactions.

Basic Authorization {#payments-processing-basic-auth-intro}
===========================================================

This section provides the information you need in order to process a basic authorization.
All supported card types can process authorizations.

Endpoint {#payments-processing-basic-auth-intro_d7e16}
------------------------------------------------------

**Production:** `POST ``https://api.example.com``/pts/v2/payments`{#payments-processing-basic-auth-intro_d7e25}  
**Test:** `POST ``https://apitest.example.com``/pts/v2/payments`{#payments-processing-basic-auth-intro_d7e35}

Declined Authorization {#payments-intro-processing-auth-decline}
================================================================

If an authorization is declined, you can use response categories to help you decide whether to retry or block a declined transaction. These response fields provide additional information:

* paymentInsightsInformation.responseInsights.category
* paymentInsightsInformation.responseInsights.categoryCode

Category codes have possible values (such as `01`) each of which corresponds to a category that contains a description.  
You cannot retry this category code and category:

* `01 ISSUER_WILL_NEVER_APPROVE`

{#payments-intro-processing-auth-decline_ul_wxl_1yx_f5b}For these values, you can retry the transaction a maximum of 15 times over a period of 30 days:


* `02 ISSUER_CANNOT_APPROVE_AT_THIS_TIME`
* `03 ISSUER_CANNOT_APPROVE_WITH_THESE_DETAILS`: Data quality issue. Revalidate data prior to retrying the transaction.
* `04 GENERIC_ERROR`
* `97 PAYMENT_INSIGHTS_INTERNAL_ERROR`
* `98 OTHERS`
* `99 PAYMENT_INSIGHTS_RESPONSE_CATEGORY_MATCH_NOT_FOUND`
  {#payments-intro-processing-auth-decline_ul_zf4_4yx_f5b}

Required Fields for Processing a Basic Authorization {#payments-processing-basic-auth-required}
===============================================================================================

> IMPORTANT  
> When relaxed requirements for address data and the expiration date are being used, not all fields in this list are required.

Authorization with Line Items {#payments-processing-basic-auth-lineitem-intro}
==============================================================================

This section shows you how to process an authorization with line items.
The main difference between a basic authorization and an authorization that includes line items is that the orderInformation.amountDetails.totalAmount field, which is included in a basic authorization, is substituted with one or more line items that are included in a lineItem\[\] array.

Fields Specific to this Use Case
--------------------------------

These fields are required for each line item that you use:

orderInformation.lineItems\[\].unitPrice
:

orderInformation.lineItems\[\].quantity
:

orderInformation.lineItems\[\].productCode
:

orderInformation.lineItems\[\].productSku
:
Optional when item_#_productCode is set to `default`, `shipping_only`, `handling_only`, or `shipping_and_handling`

orderInformation.lineItems\[\].productName
:
Optional when item_#_productCode is set to `default`, `shipping_only`, `handling_only`, or `shipping_and_handling`
{#payments-processing-basic-auth-lineitem-intro_dl_ht4_hlx_rxb}  
At a minimum, you must include the orderInformation.lineItems\[\].unitPrice field in order to include a line item in an authorization. When this field is the only field included in the authorization, the system sets:

* orderInformation.lineItems\[\].productCode: `default`
* orderInformation.lineItems\[\].quantity: `1`

For example, these three line items are valid.

```
"orderInformation": {
  "lineItems": [
    {
      "unitPrice": "10.00"
    },
    {
      "unitPrice": "5.99",
      "quantity": "3",
      "productCode": "shipping_only"
    },
    {
      "unitPrice": "29.99",
      "quantity": "3",
      "productCode": "electronic_good",
      "productSku": "12384569",
      "productName": "receiver"
    }
  ]
}

Authorization with a Card Verification Number {#payments-auth-cvn-procedure}
============================================================================

This section shows you how to process an authorization with a Card Verification Number (CVN).

CVN Results
-----------

The response includes a raw response code and a mapped response code:

* The raw response code is the value returned by the processor. This value is returned in the processorInformation.cardVerification.resultCodeRaw field. Use this value only for debugging purposes; do not use it to determine the card verification response.
* The mapped response code is the pre-defined value that corresponds to the raw response code. This value is returned in the processorInformation.cardVerification.resultCode field.  
  Even when the CVN does not match the expected value, the issuing bank might still authorize the transaction. You will receive a CVN decline, but you can still capture the transaction because it has been authorized by the bank. However, you must review the order to ensure that it is legitimate.  
  Settling authorizations that fail the CVN check might have an impact on the fees charged by your bank. Contact your bank for details about how card verification management might affect your discount rate.  
  When a CVN decline is received for the authorization in a sale request, the capture request is not processed unless you set the processingInformation.authorizationOptions.ignoreCvResult field to `true`.

CVN Results for American Express
:
A value of `1` in the processorInformation.cardVerification.resultCode field indicates that your account is not configured to use card verification. Contact customer support to have your account enabled for this feature.

CVN Results for Discover
:
When the CVN does not match, Discover refuses the card and the request is declined. The reply message does not include the processorInformation.cardVerification.resultCode field, which indicates that the CVN failed.

CVN Results for Relay and Mastercard
:
A CVN code of `D` or `N` causes the request to be declined with a reason code value of `230`. You can still capture the transaction, but you must review the order to ensure that it is legitimate.

    `Payment Gateway`, not the issuer, assigns the CVN decline to the authorization. You can capture any authorization that has a valid authorization code from the issuer, even when the request receives a CVN decline.

    When the issuer does not authorize the transaction and the CVN does not match, the request is declined because the card is refused. You cannot capture the transaction.

Marketplace Authorization with Foreign Retailers {#payments-processing-foreign-auth-intro}
==========================================================================================

`Platform Connect` requires marketplaces to identify foreign retail transactions when the marketplace and issuer are in the European Economic Area (EEA), the U.K., and Gibraltar and the retailer is in a different country. For marketplace transactions, the marketplace is the merchant and the retailer is the sub-merchant. Marketplace foreign retail transactions are identified in the `Business Center` on the transactions details page.

> IMPORTANT  
> This feature is intended for captures. You can include this information in an authorization, but this is not the preferred method. The capture request data overrides the authorization request data.

Fields Specific to this Use Case
--------------------------------

These fields are required for this use case:

aggregatorInformation.subMerchant.country
:
Set this value to the retailer country.

merchantInformation.merchantDescriptor.country

Authorization with Strong Customer Authentication Exemption {#payments-processing-pa-sca-exempts-intro}
=======================================================================================================

This section shows you how to process an authorization with a strong customer authentication (SCA) exemption.  
You can use SCA exemptions to streamline the payment process. SCA exemptions are part of the European second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and allow certain types of low-risk transactions to bypass additional authentication steps while still remaining compliant with PSD2. You can choose which exemption can be applied to a transaction, but the card-issuing bank actually grants an SCA exemption during card authentication.  
You can process an authorization with two types of SCA exemptions:

* **Exemption on Authorization**: Send an authorization without payer authentication and request an SCA exemption on the authorization. If it is not approved, you may be required to request further authentication upon retry.
* **Exemption on Authentication**: Request an SCA exemption during payer authentication and if successful, send an authorization including the SCA exemption details.  
  Depending on your processor, use one of these exemption fields:

> IMPORTANT If you send more than one SCA exemption field with a single authentication, the transaction is denied.

* **Authentication Outage**: Payer authentication is not available for this transaction due to a system outage.
* **B2B Corporate Card**: Payment cards specifically for business-to-business transactions are exempt.
* **Delegated Authentication**: Payer authentication was performed outside of the authorization workflow.
* **Follow-On Installment Payment**: Installment payments of a fixed amount are exempt after the first transaction.
* **Follow-On Recurring Payment**: Recurring payments of a fixed amount are exempt after the first transaction.
* **Low Risk**: The average fraud levels associated with this transaction are considered low.
* **Low Value**: The transaction value does not warrant SCA.
* **Merchant Initiated Transactions**: As follow-on transactions, merchant-initiated transactions are exempt.
* **Stored Credential Transaction**: Credentials are authenticated before storing, so stored credential transactions are exempt.
* **Trusted Merchant**: Merchants registered as trusted beneficiaries.

Account Verification with a Zero Amount Authorization {#payments-processing-basic-zero-auth-intro}
==================================================================================================

Account verification with zero amount authorization is a standard e-commerce practice where you send a zero amount transaction to verify a card is valid and whether the card is lost or stolen. You cannot capture a zero amount authorization.  
Most card networks refer to card account validation as zero amount authorization (ZAA). These card networks have their own names for the service:

* Discover Zero Dollar Authorization
* Relay Account Verification

{#payments-processing-basic-zero-auth-intro_ul_j3f_tsl_qhc}

Processor-Specific Information
------------------------------

`Platform Connect`
:
AVS and CVN are supported.
:
Card types: Mastercard, Relay
:
Supported for Internet, MOTO, and card-present transactions. Do not try to perform a zero amount authorization for a recurring payment, installment payment, or payer authorization transaction.

Account Name Inquiry with a Zero Amount Authorization {#payments-processing-zero-auth-ani-intro}
================================================================================================

Account name inquiry (ANI) is an optional enhancement to the zero-amount authorization for verifying that the customer's name matches the name on their card account with the issuing bank. ANI verification reduces fraud risk, especially for an account funding transaction (AFT) or original credit transaction (OCT).  
ANI verification is useful in these scenarios:

* Customer account set up.
* Before an AFT or OCT.
* To support regulatory and anti-money laundering expectations, particularly in gambling and money movement cases.

How to Request an ANI
---------------------

ANI does not run automatically.  
To request an ANI verification on a zero amount authorization, include the processingInformation.cardVerification.checkANI field in the authorization request, and set the value to `Y`.

Card Types {#payments-processing-zero-auth-ani-intro_ani-card-rules}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

ANI is available for Mastercard and Relay. More card types will support ANI in the future.

Handling Match Results
----------------------

Use match results to decide whether to proceed, retry, or flag the transaction for fraud checks.  
The ANI response includes name match results in these fields:

* processorInformation.merchantAdvice.nameMatch  
  Possible values:
  * `00`: Name match performed
  * `01`: Name match not performed
  * `02`: Name match not supported
* processorInformation.electronicVerificationResults.code  
  Possible values:
  * `Y`: Match
  * `N`: No match
  * `O`: Partial match
  * `U`: Not performed or supported
* processorInformation.electronicVerificationResults.firstName  
  Possible values:
  * `Y`: Match
  * `N`: No match
  * `O`: Partial match
  * `U`: Not performed or supported
* processorInformation.electronicVerificationResults.lastName  
  Possible values:
  * `Y`: Match
  * `N`: No match
  * `O`: Partial match
  * `U`: Not performed or supported
* processorInformation.electronicVerificationResults.middleName  
  Possible values:
  * `Y`: Match
  * `N`: No match
  * `O`: Partial match
  * `U`: Not performed or supported

Controlling ANI Results
-----------------------

By default, a no match or partial match ANI result might not result in a decline.  
You can change this behavior by including the processingInformation.authorizationOptions.declineAniFlags request field to specify a space-separated list of ANI result codes. If the ANI response matches one of those values, the transaction is declined.  
Example: `decline_ani_flags = N O ` results in a decline on **No match** or **Partial match**.  
The decline response code is `ANI_FAILED`.

Pre-Authorization {#payments-processing-pre-auth-intro}
=======================================================

This section provides the information you need in order to process a pre-authorization.  
A pre-authorization enables you to authorize a payment when the final amount is unknown. The system places the funds on hold until you request a follow-up transaction. Pre-authorizations are typically used for lodging, auto rental, e-commerce, and restaurant transactions.
IMPORTANT Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) rules in the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) require the initial pre-authorization to use strong customer authentication for merchants or customers in PSD2-applicable countries.  
When you have a specific merchant category code (MCC) assigned to your account, you are allowed to capture up to 20% more than the cumulatively authorized amount on Relay, Diners Club, Discover, and JCB cards. Contact your account manager to have your account enabled for this option.  
For a pre-authorization:

* The authorization amount is greater than zero.
* Submit the authorization for capture within 30 calendar days of its request.
* When you do not capture the authorization, reverse it.  
  In the US, Canada, Latin America, and Asia Pacific, Mastercard charges an additional fee for a pre-authorization that is not captured and not reversed.  
  In Europe, Russia, Middle East, and Africa, Mastercard charges fees for all pre-authorizations.
* Chargeback protection is in effect for 30 days after the authorization.
  All supported card types can process pre-authorizations.

Requirements for Final Authorizations {#payments-final-auth-indicator-final-auth}
=================================================================================

For a final authorization:

* The authorization amount must be greater than zero.
* The authorization amount must be the final amount that the customer agrees to pay.
* The authorization should not be cancelled after it is approved except when a system failure occurs.

IMPORTANT Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) rules in the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) require the initial pre-authorization to use strong customer authentication for merchants or customers in PSD2-applicable countries.  
When you have a specific merchant category code (MCC) assigned to your account, you are allowed to capture up to 20% more than the cumulatively authorized amount on Relay, Diners Club, Discover, and JCB cards. Contact your account manager to have your account enabled for this option.  
For a pre-authorization:

* The authorization amount is greater than zero.
* Submit the authorization for capture within 30 calendar days of its request.
* When you do not capture the authorization, reverse it.  
  In the US, Canada, Latin America, and Asia Pacific, Mastercard charges an additional fee for a pre-authorization that is not captured and not reversed.  
  In Europe, Russia, Middle East, and Africa, Mastercard charges fees for all pre-authorizations.
* Chargeback protection is in effect for 30 days after the authorization.

Unmarked Authorizations {#payments-final-auth-indicator-unmarked-auth}
======================================================================

An authorization is unmarked when the default authorization type is not set in your account and you do not include the processingInformation.authorizationOptions.authIndicator field in the authorization request. To set the default authorization type in your account, contact customer support.  
Unmarked authorizations are supported only in the US, Canada, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. They are not supported in Europe, Russia, Middle East, and Africa.  
`Payment Gateway` does not set a mark or indicator for the type of authorization in the request that is sent to the processor.
IMPORTANT Your acquirer processes an unmarked authorization as a final authorization, a pre-authorization, or an undefined authorization. Contact your acquirer to learn how they process unmarked authorizations.

Requirements for Unmarked Authorizations {#payments-final-auth-indicator-unmarked-auth2}
========================================================================================

An authorization is undefined when you set the default authorization type in your account to undefined and do not include the authIndicator field in the authorization request. To set the default authorization type in your account, contact customer support.  
Undefined authorizations are supported only in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. They are not supported in Europe, Russia, Middle East, and Africa.  
Chargeback protection is in effect for seven days after the authorization.

Authorization Reversal {#payments-processing-basic-auth-reversal-intro}
=======================================================================

This section provides the information about how to process an authorization reversal.  
Reversing an authorization releases the hold on the customer's payment card funds that the issuing bank placed when processing the authorization.  
For a debit card or prepaid card in which only a partial amount was approved, the amount of the reversal must be the amount that was authorized, not the amount that was requested.  
All supported card types can process authorization reversals.

Endpoint {#payments-processing-basic-auth-reversal-intro_d7e85}

Partial Authorization Reversal {#payments-processing-basic-inc-auth-reversal-intro}
===================================================================================

A partial authorization reversal releases a partial amount of the authorized funds held on the customer's payment card. Process a partial authorization reversal when the captured funds are less than the total authorized amount. This typically occurs when the final bill amount is less than the total amount of the combined original authorization and incremental authorizations.  
Primary use cases include:

* Variable amount services

  * Hotels release unused pre-authorized amounts after checkout.
  * Car rentals release unused security hold portions.
  * Fuel stations release funds when the final pump amount is less than the initial pre-authorization.
* Partial shipment and fulfillment

  * You ship part of an order and do not charge for the remainder of the order.
* Subscription boxes or bundles include items that are unavailable.  
  Process partial authorization reversals in these sequences:

* Pre-authorization or standard authorization, then a partial authorization reversal, and lastly a capture.

* Pre-authorization, then an incremental authorization, then a partial authorization reversal, and lastly a capture.  
  The total authorized amount during a reversal or capture request is the original authorized amount plus the incremental authorized amount minus any previous partial authorized reversal amounts and non-voided captures.

Supported Card Types
--------------------

Partial authorization reversals support these card types:

* American Express
* Discover
* Maestro
* Maestro International
* JCB (in US and European Union (EU) regions)
* Mastercard
* Relay

American Express Card Requirements
----------------------------------

When you process a payment with an American Express card, reverse any remaining authorized funds that are not captured. For example, if the total amount of the initial authorization and all of the incremental authorizations is 100.00, and the captured amount is 80.00, then reverse the difference of 20.00.

Processing an Incremental Authorization with a Partial Authorization Reversal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete these tasks to reverse any remaining authorized funds that are not captured:

1. Send an initial authorization request that places a hold on the customer's funds and saves the card as a card-on-file. This is also known as an estimated authorization request. For more information, see the *Credentialed Transactions Developer Guide*.
2. For every anticipated additional charge, send an incremental authorization. For more information, see [Incremental Authorization](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-processing-basic-intro/payments-processing-basic-auth-inc-intro.md "").
3. When the customer is ready to complete the payment, send a capture request for the final amount. For more information, see [Capture](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-processing-basic-intro/payments-processing-basic-capture-intro.md "").
4. If there are remaining authorized funds that are not captured, send a partial authorization reversal to remove the hold on the funds.

Relaxed Error Scenarios
-----------------------

Errors are relaxed for these scenarios:

* When the reversal amount is not equal to the authorized amount, an error does not occur unless the reversal amount is greater than the authorized amount.

* You can process multiple partial authorization reversals, and an error occurs only when the reversal amount exceeds the total remaining authorized amount.

* Transactions can be reversed and settled multiple times as long as the total reversal and settled amount do not exceed the total authorized amount.  
  Relaxed error codes include:

* `237`: Decline - The authorization has already been reversed (AUTH_ALREADY_REVERSED)

* `238`: Decline - The transaction has already been settled (TRANSACTION_ALREADY_SETTLED)

* `243`: Decline - The transaction has already been settled or reversed (TRANSACTION_ALREADY_REVERSED_OR_SETTLED)

Time-Out Authorization Reversal {#payments-timeout-auth-reversals-intro}
========================================================================

When you do not receive a response message after sending an authorization request, this feature enables you to reverse the authorization that you requested.
IMPORTANT Wait 60 seconds before requesting a time-out authorization reversal.  
Include the clientReferenceInformation.transactionId field in the original request for an authorization. The value of the merchant transaction ID must be unique for 180 days.  
When the original transaction fails, the response message for the reversal request includes these fields:

* reversalAmountDetails.originalTransactionAmount
* processorInformation.responseCode

Requirements
------------

Unless your processor supports authorization reversal after void (ARAV), time-out authorization reversals are supported only for authorizations that have not been captured and settled.

Marketplace Capture with Foreign Retailers {#payments-processing-foreign-capture-intro}
=======================================================================================

`Platform Connect` requires marketplaces to identify foreign retail transactions when the marketplace and issuer are in the European Economic Area (EEA), the U.K., and Gibraltar and the retailer is in a different country. For marketplace transactions, the marketplace is the merchant and the retailer is the sub-merchant. Marketplace foreign retail transactions are identified in the `Business Center` on the transactions details page.

> IMPORTANT  
> The capture request data overrides the authorization request data.

Forced Capture {#payments-forced-capture}
=========================================

This feature allows merchants to process authorizations obtained through an organization other than `Payment Gateway`. For example, a merchant might call their processor to request a manual authorization, at which point they can request a forced capture of the authorization.  
A manual authorization cannot be captured for more than the original authorization amount, and the authorization expires after seven days.

Follow-On Refund {#payments-processing-basic-refund-intro}
==========================================================

This section provides the information you need in order to process a follow-on refund, which is linked to a capture or sale. You must request a follow-on refund within 180 days of the authorization or sale.
When your account is enabled for credit authorizations, also known as purchase return authorizations, `Payment Gateway` authenticates the card and customer during a follow-on refund or stand-alone credit request. Every credit request is automatically authorized.  
Credit authorizations are handled the same for these card types:

* American Express

* Diners

* Discover

* JCB

* Mastercard

* Relay  
  Credit authorization results are returned in these response fields:

* processorInformation.approvalCode

* processorInformation.networkTransactionId

* processorInformation.responseCode
  {#payments-processing-basic-refund-intro_d24e49}  
  When you request a void for a refund or credit before settlement, the refund or credit is voided. If your account is enabled for credit authorizations, the credit authorization is also reversed. All supported card types can process follow-on refunds.

Payer Authentication Processing {#payments-processing-pa-process-intro}
=======================================================================

This section shows you how to process authorizations with these payer authentication methods:

* **American Express**: SafeKey
* **JCB**: J/Secure
* **Mastercard**: Identity Check
* **Relay**: Relay Secure
  {#payments-processing-pa-process-intro_ul_dqz_xll_5xb}

Providing Payer Authentication Information for Authorization {#payments-processing-pa-eci}
==========================================================================================

The values that are returned from payer authentication must be provided when seeking authorization for the transaction. Authentication information that is not included when considering authorization may cause the transaction to be refused or downgraded and prevent the normal liability shift from occurring.  
The level of security in payer authentication is indicated by the two-digit e-commerce indicator (ECI) that is assigned to the transaction. These values have text equivalents that are assigned to the processingInformation.commerceIndicator field. The American Express, China UnionPay, Diners Club, Discover, and Relay card brands use `05`, `06`, and `07` digit values to express the authentication level for a `3-D Secure` transaction.

| ECI Value | Meaning                                    | Relay                 | Diners Club  | Discover       | China UnionPay         | American Express |
|:----------|:-------------------------------------------|:---------------------|:-------------|:---------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------|
| `05`      | Authenticated                              | vbv                  | pb           | dipb           | up3ds                  | aesk             |
| `06`      | Attempted authentication with a cryptogram | vbv_attempted        | pb_attempted | dipb_attempted | up3ds_attempted        | aesk_attempted   |
| `07`      | Internet, not authenticated                | vbv_failure/internet | internet     | internet       | up3ds_failure/internet | internet         |
[Text Values for ECI Values]

Mastercard and Maestro cards use 00, 01, 02, 06, and 07 digit values to indicate the authentication level of the transaction.

| ECI Value | Meaning                                                           | Mastercard/Maestro |
|:----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| `00`      | Internet, not authenticated                                       | spa/internet       |
| `01`      | Attempted authentication                                          | spa                |
| `02`      | Authenticated                                                     | spa                |
| `06`      | Exemption from authentication or network token without 3‑D Secure | spa                |
| `07`      | Authenticated merchant-initiated transaction                      | spa                |
[Mastercard/Maestro Text Values for ECI Values]

The payer authentication response contains other information that needs to be passed on for successful authorization. Be sure to include these fields when requesting a separate authorization:

* consumerAuthenticationInformation.directoryServerTransactionId (Mastercard, Maestro, UPI only)
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.eciRaw
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.paresStatus
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.paSpecificationVersion
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.ucafAuthenticationData (Mastercard/Maestro only)
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.ucafCollectionIndicator (Mastercard/Maestro only)
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.cavv
* consumerAuthenticationInformation.xid

American Express SafeKey {#payments-processing-pa-amex-intro}
=============================================================

American Express SafeKey is the authentication service in the American Express card network that uses the 3-D Secure protocol to validate customers at checkout. When you request an authorization using a supported card type and a supported processor, you can include payer authentication data in the request.  
Before implementing payer authentication for American Express SafeKey, contact customer support to have your account configured for this feature.

Fields Specific to the American Express SafeKey Use Case
--------------------------------------------------------

These API fields are required specifically for this use case.

consumerAuthenticationInformation.cavv

JCB J/Secure {#payments-processing-pa-jcb-intro}
================================================

JCB J/Secure is the authentication service in the JCB card network that uses the 3-D Secure protocol to validate customers at checkout. When you request an authorization using a supported card type and a supported processor, you can include payer authentication data in the request. The payer authentication services enable you to add payer authentication support to your website without running additional software on your server.  
Before implementing payer authentication for JCB J/Secure, contact customer support to have your account configured for this feature.

Mastercard Identity Check {#payments-processing-pa-mc-intro}
============================================================

Mastercard Identity Check is the authentication service in the Mastercard card network that uses the 3-D Secure protocol in online transactions to authenticate customers at checkout.  
Mastercard Identity Check generates a unique, 32-character transaction token, called the account authentication value (AAV) each time a Mastercard Identity Check-enabled account holder makes an online purchase. The AAV binds the account holder to a specific transaction. Mastercard Identity Check transactions use the universal cardholder authentication field (UCAF) as a standard to collect and pass AAV data.  
Before implementing payer authentication for Mastercard Identity Check, contact customer support to have your account configured for this feature.

Relay Secure {#payments-processing-pa-relay-intro}
================================================

Relay Secure is the authentication service in the Relay card network that uses the 3-D Secure protocol to authenticate customers at checkout. This authentication is a two-step process. First, the cardholder is authenticated by 3-D Secure. Then, the transaction is authorized based on the 3-D Secure evaluation. This section explains how to authorize a card payment based on the 3-D Secure evaluation.  
Before implementing Relay Secure, contact customer support to have your account configured for this feature.

Fields Specific to the Relay Secure Use Case
-------------------------------------------

These API fields are required specifically for this use case.

processingInformation.commerceIndicator
:
Set the value to `vbv` for a successful authentication (3-D Secure value of `05`), `vbv_attempted` if authentication was attempted but did not succeed (3-D Secure value of `06`), or `vbv_failure` if authentication failed (3-D Secure value of `07`).

consumerAuthenticationInformation.cavv
:
Required when payer authentication is successful.

Relaxed Requirements for Address Data and Expiration Date in a Payment {#payments-relax-reqs}
=============================================================================================

With relaxed requirements for address data and the expiration date, not all standard payment request fields are required. It is your responsibility to determine whether your account is enabled to use this feature and which fields are required.

Requirements {#payments-relax-reqs-reqs}
========================================

You must contact customer support in order to enable relaxed requirements for address data and expiration date.

Services {#payments-relax-reqs-services}
========================================

Relaxed requirements for address data and expiration date are supported for these services:

* Authorization
* Capture
* Stand-alone credit
* Subscription create
* Subscription update

Relaxed Fields {#payments-relax-reqs-fields}
============================================

> IMPORTANT
> When relaxed requirements for address data and expiration date are enabled for your ` Payment Gateway ` account, and your service request does not include one or more of the fields in the following list, you increase the risk of declined transactions and fraud depending on your location, your processor, and the cardholder's issuing bank.  
> It is your responsibility to determine whether a field is required for the transaction you are requesting. For example, an issuing bank can decline an authorization request for a recurring transaction with a Relay Europe card if the expiration date is incorrect, invalid, or missing. If you do not provide the correct expiration date for a recurring transaction the authorization request may be declined.

Split Shipments Processing {#payments-processing-basic-split-ship-intro}
========================================================================

Split shipments enable you to split an order into multiple shipments with multiple captures. You can use this feature when a customer orders a product that is not yet available.

> IMPORTANT
> Split shipments are not available for Mastercard transactions in the IDR currency on ` Platform Connect `.
> *Multiple partial captures* and *split shipments* are not the same feature. The processor provides the multiple partial captures feature, while `Payment Gateway` provides the split shipment feature.

Requirements for Using Split Shipments
--------------------------------------

The requirements for using split shipments are you must use `Platform Connect` and contact customer support to have your account configured for this feature.

> IMPORTANT
> A ` Platform Connect ` account can only be enabled for either the multiple partial captures or split shipments feature, but not both.

Authorizing a Sale for a Product Not Yet Available {#payments-processing-basic-split-ship-one-auth-sale-intro}
==============================================================================================================

When the customer purchases a product that is not yet available, you can request an authorization and a sale. First request an authorization to ensure that funds are available. After the product becomes available, ship the product and request a sale. `Payment Gateway` then links the follow-on authorization to the first authorization, and then links to the capture request.

#### Figure:

Authorizing a Sale for a Product not yet Available  
![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/payments/images/payments-ss-scenario-one.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
**Step 1: Requesting an authorization**  
Request an authorization to ensure that funds are available before the product is available for immediate shipment. The authorization request requires no additional fields or requirements than a basic authorization.  
**Step 2: Processing a sale**  
When the product becomes available, ship the product and request a sale. The follow-on authorization requires you to submit a sale request that includes the processingInformation.linkId field in addition to the basic fields required for every sale request. The processingInformation.linkId field in an authorization request triggers the split-shipment functionality.  
Set the processingInformation.linkId field to the {id} value from the endpoint.  
**Field Specific to authorizing a sale for a product not yet available:**  
First Authorization Response: The {id} value is returned in the endpoint.  
Follow-on Authorization Request: `processingInformation.linkId=SWVdPS5IM`  
**Step 3: `Payment Gateway` attempts to link the follow-on authorization request to the first authorization**

* If the processingInformation.linkId value is valid, the follow-on authorization is linked to the original authorization in the `Business Center` and in reports.
* If the processingInformation.linkId value is not valid, the follow-on authorization is not linked to the original authorization in the `Business Center` and in reports.

{#payments-processing-basic-split-ship-one-auth-sale-intro_ul_nvp_44z_wwb}  
**Step 4: `Payment Gateway` links the capture request**

* If the processingInformation.linkId value for the follow-on authorization was valid, all three transactions (first authorization, follow-on authorization, capture) are linked together in the `Business Center` and in reports.
* If the processingInformation.linkId value for the follow-on authorization was not valid, the second authorization and capture are linked to each other in the `Business Center` and in reports, but they are not linked to the first authorization.

Processing Two Authorizations and a Capture for Multiple Products {#payments-processing-basic-split-ship-two-auth-cap-intro}
============================================================================================================================

When the customer purchases a product that is not yet available, you can request two authorizations and a capture. First request an authorization to ensure that funds are available, and then ship the available products. After the remaining products become available, request follow-on authorization to ensure funds are still available. Ship the remaining products, and request a capture. `Payment Gateway` links the follow-on authorization to the first authorization and the capture request to the other transactions.

**Step 1: Requesting an authorization**  
Request an authorization to ensure that funds are available for one or more of the products that are available for immediate shipment. The authorization request requires no additional fields or requirements than a basic authorization.  
**Step 2: Requesting a follow-on authorization**  
After the product becomes available, request a follow-on authorization to ensure that funds are still available. The follow-on authorization request must include the processingInformation.linkId field in addition to the basic fields required for every authorization request. The processingInformation.linkId field in an authorization request triggers the split shipment functionality.  
Set the processingInformation.linkId field to the {id} value from the endpoint.  
**Field specific to requesting a follow-on authorization request:**  
First Authorization Response: The {id} value is returned in the endpoint.  
Follow-on Authorization Request: `processingInformation.linkId=SWVdPS5IM`  
**Step 3: `Payment Gateway` attempts to link the follow-on authorization request to the first authorization**

* If the processingInformation.linkId value is valid, the follow-on authorization is linked to the original authorization in the `Business Center` and in reports.
* If the processingInformation.linkId value is not valid, the follow-on authorization is not linked to the original authorization in the `Business Center` and in reports.

{#payments-processing-basic-split-ship-two-auth-cap-intro_ul_nvp_44z_wwb}  
**Step 4: Requesting a capture**  
You ship the product and request a capture. The capture request requires only the basic fields as any capture request.  
**Step 5: `Payment Gateway` attempts to link the capture request to the other transactions**  
All three transactions (first authorization, follow-on authorization, capture) are linked together in the `Business Center` and in reports.  
See [Basic Authorization](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-processing-basic-intro/payments-processing-basic-auth-intro.md "") for information on how to process a basic authorization. See [Capture](/docs/gateway/en-us/payments/developer/ctv/rest/payments/payments-processing-basic-intro/payments-processing-basic-capture-intro.md "") for information on how to process a capture.

Processing an Authorization and Two Captures for Multiple Products {#payments-processing-basic-split-ship-one-auth-two-cap-intro}
=================================================================================================================================

When the customer orders multiple products and one is not available, you must request an authorization to ensure funds are available. You ship the products that are available and request a capture for the amount of the shipped products. When the remaining product becomes available, ship the product and request a follow-on capture for the amount of the product. `Payment Gateway` performs a system-generated authorization for the follow-on capture request. `Payment Gateway` then links the capture request. You receive the status of the follow-on capture request and its associated system-generated authorization.

#### Figure:

Processing an Authorization and Two Captures for Multiple Products  
![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/payments-processing/card-processing/payments/images/payments-ss-scenario-three.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)  
**Step 1: Requesting an authorization**  
Request an authorization to ensure that funds are available for one or more products that are available for immediate shipment. The authorization request requires no additional fields or requirements other than a basic authorization.  
**Step 2: Requesting a capture**  
Ship the available product and request a capture while you wait for the remaining product to become available. The capture request requires only the basic fields as any capture request.  
**Step 3: Requesting a follow-on capture**  
When the remaining product becomes available, ship it and request a capture for that amount. The capture request requires only the basic fields as any capture request.  
**Step 4: `Payment Gateway` performs a system-generated authorization**  
`Payment Gateway` performs a system-generated authorization for the follow-on capture request and link it to the original authorization in the `Business Center` and in reports. `Payment Gateway` processes the capture request as a split shipment request because your account is already enabled for split shipments.  
**Step 5: `Payment Gateway` attempts to link the capture request to the other transactions**  
The capture is linked to the authorizations in the `Business Center` and in reports through the request IDs as with any capture. All four transactions (first authorization, system-generated authorization, first capture, follow-on capture) are linked together in the `Business Center` and in reports.  
**Step 6: `Payment Gateway` provides the status**  
The status of the follow-on capture request and its associated system-generated authorization becomes available.
