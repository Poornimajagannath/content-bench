CARD Platform Connect: Specifications and Conditions for Resellers/Partners {#vpc-partner-reseller-disclaimer}
==============================================================================================================

The following are specifications and conditions that apply to a Reseller/Partner enabling its merchants through Payment Gateway for Platform Connect ("VPC") processing. Failure to meet any of the specifications and conditions below is subject to the liability provisions and indemnification obligations under Reseller/Partner's contract with Relay/Payment Gateway.

1. Before boarding merchants for payment processing on a VPC acquirer's connection, Reseller/Partner and the VPC acquirer must have a contract or other legal agreement that permits Reseller/Partner to enable its merchants to process payments with the acquirer through the dedicated VPC connection and/or traditional connection with such VPC acquirer.
2. Reseller/Partner is responsible for boarding and enabling its merchants in accordance with the terms of the contract or other legal agreement with the relevant VPC acquirer.
3. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that all considerations and fees associated with chargebacks, interchange downgrades, settlement issues, funding delays, and other processing related activities are strictly between Reseller and the relevant VPC acquirer.
4. Reseller/Partner acknowledges and agrees that the relevant VPC acquirer is responsible for payment processing issues, including but not limited to, transaction declines by network/issuer, decline rates, and interchange qualification, as may be agreed to or outlined in the contract or other legal agreement between Reseller/Partner and such VPC acquirer.

DISCLAIMER: NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS BY THE Platform Connect ACQUIRER IN PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS. NEITHER CARD NOR PAYMENT GATEWAY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR RESELLER/PARTNER BOARDING MERCHANTS OR ENABLING MERCHANT PROCESSING IN VIOLATION OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE RELEVANT Platform Connect ACQUIRER.

Introduction to OAuth 2.0 Integration {#home}
=============================================

OAuth 2.0 enables your `Payment Gateway` merchants to securely grant your web-application permission to perform actions on their behalf, such as accessing their customer data and processing transactions. As a technology partner, you can integrate OAuth 2.0 into your web-application through `Payment Gateway`. When your integration is complete, `Payment Gateway` authenticates merchants for you, ensuring that your web-application only performs actions authorized by the merchants. This authentication method securely connects your web-application to the merchant account without the need to receive or store sensitive merchant credentials in your system.  
This guide explains how you, a technology partner, can set up and enable OAuth 2.0 for your web-application.

> IMPORTANT
> OAuth integration through ` Payment Gateway ` is in the pilot phase. To join the pilot program, and to know which API requests are OAuth-enabled, contact ` Payment Gateway ` support:  
> ` `[technology-partners.html](https://developer.example.com/technology-partners.md "")` `

Additional Information about OAuth 2.0
--------------------------------------

OAuth is an industry-standard authorization protocol that enables an application to delegate limited access to another application. For more information about the OAuth open technical standard, see this OAuth 2.0 description from the official OAuth website:  
[`https://oauth.net/2/`](https://oauth.net/2/ "")

How to Set Up OAuth 2.0 {#implementation-overview}
==================================================

This overview describes the steps that you and the merchant must complete to implement OAuth.

#### Figure:

OAuth 2.0 Implementation ![](/content/dam/documentation/pgw/en-us/topics/platform/bam/oauth/images/oauth-implement-700x400.svg/jcr:content/renditions/original)

1. You enable mutual authentication by obtaining a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) from a supported certificate authority (CA). After obtaining a CSR, you provide your common name details to `Payment Gateway`. For more information, see [Enable Mutual Authentication](/docs/gateway/en-us/oauth/developer/all/rest/oauth/Supporting-Mutual-Authentication.md "").

2. You register your web-application in the `Business Center` and set a scope of permissions and a redirect URL to your web-application. For more information, see [Register Your Application](/docs/gateway/en-us/oauth/developer/all/rest/oauth/register-application.md "").

3. The merchant accesses your web-application, logs into their account using their credentials, and clicks a button or link to set up their `Payment Gateway` account.

4. Your application redirects the merchant to a `Payment Gateway`-hosted webpage. For more information, see [Redirect the Merchant](/docs/gateway/en-us/oauth/developer/all/rest/oauth/redirect-merchant-to-pgw.md "").

5. The merchant logs in to their `Payment Gateway` account and approves your request. This authorizes your web-application to perform specific actions on their behalf which are set by the permissions scope that the merchant approved. Notify the merchant that their account must have access to grant OAuth permissions to complete this requirement.

6. `Payment Gateway` redirects the merchant to your application using the redirect URL you registered. An authentication code is appended to the redirect URL. For more information, see [Interpreting the Redirect Response](/docs/gateway/en-us/oauth/developer/all/rest/oauth/redirect-merchant-to-pgw/response-parameters.md "").

7. Your application exchanges the authorization code with `Payment Gateway` for these two tokens:

   * **Access token** : A token to authenticate transactions using `Payment Gateway`. For more information about how to authenticate `Payment Gateway` transactions using this token, see [Submit API Requests Using OAuth](/docs/gateway/en-us/oauth/developer/all/rest/oauth/submitting-api-request-using-pgw-extend.md "").
   * **Refresh token**: A token that you can use to request additional access tokens.

   For more information about requesting tokens, see [Request the Access and Refresh Tokens](/docs/gateway/en-us/oauth/developer/all/rest/oauth/obtaining-access-refresh-tokens.md "").  
   For more information about refreshing your existing tokens, see [Refresh the Access Token](/docs/gateway/en-us/oauth/developer/all/rest/oauth/refreshing-access-token.md "") and [Refresh the Refresh Token](/docs/gateway/en-us/oauth/developer/all/rest/oauth/refreshing-the-refresh-token.md "").

To change the permissions the merchant grants you, you must repeat steps 2--7.  
You can view examples of these steps in the [demo application](https://oauthsample.test.example.com/payment-gateway-oauth-app/ "").  
You must obtain test merchant credentials to emulate the access delegation. Your test account must contain at least one card-based transaction from within the past 7 days. To sign up for a sandbox test account to create your test credentials, see:  
[`https://developer.example.com/hello-world/sandbox.html`](https://developer.example.com/hello-world/sandbox.md "")

Enable Mutual Authentication {#Supporting-Mutual-Authentication_id2024I060BY4}
==============================================================================

OAuth uses *mutual authentication* to provide an additional layer of security. Mutual authentication occurs when a client and server verify each other's identities simultaneously. To enable mutual authentication, you must use a server-to-server certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Before you can register your application with `Payment Gateway`, you must create one of these supported DigiCert CAs and enable mutual authentication:

Supported DigiCert CAs
:
* X9 Financial PKI -- ECC P-256 Root
* X9 Financial PKI -- RSA 2048 Root
* X9 Financial PKI -- RSA 4096 Root

:
Contact support to obtain a certificate from DigiCert: [`https://www.digicert.com/contact-us`](https://www.digicert.com/contact-us "")

Deprecated DigiCert CAs and Transition Guidance
-----------------------------------------------

These CAs are no longer supported:

* DigiCert Assured ID Root G2
* DigiCert Global G2 TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1
* DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA
* DigiCert SHA2 Extended Validation Server CA

> IMPORTANT  
> If your current integration uses a deprecated DigiCert CA, obtain one of the supported certificates when your existing certificates expire or are due for renewal.  
> DigiCert has announced that the Client Authentication EKU will be removed from public TLS certificates to comply with industry requirements. Without this EKU, certificates cannot be used for client authentication in mTLS, which is essential for secure OAuth integrations. If your organization uses DigiCert certificates for mTLS, client authentication, or server-to-server authentication, review the DigiCert article [*"What should I do to prepare for the Client Authentication EKU removal from public TLS certificates?"*](https://knowledge.digicert.com/alerts/sunsetting-client-authentication-eku-from-digicert-public-tls-certificates#what-do-you-need-to-do ""). This article explains if your certificate usage is affected and describes DigiCert alternatives.  
> To download the supported X9 production root and intermediate certificates used for mTLS, see the DigiCert article [*X9 Production Certificates for mTLS*](https://knowledge.digicert.com/general-information/community-root-authority-certificates#X9Certificates "").

Set Up Tasks
------------

You must complete these tasks to enable mutual authentication:
1. Create a new key pair and Certificate Signing Request, using a server-to-server certificate from your CA.
2. Submit the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to support for your CA and provide the required details.
3. Your CA verifies your request, and if they approve it, they issue the certificate in an email to the technical contact for your account.
4. Give the certificate's common name to your `Payment Gateway` technical contact. Your technical contact adds it to the `Payment Gateway` whitelist. IMPORTANT Your certificate's common name can only contain up to 40 characters.  
   To test your own application, you can use the certificate that is available with the `Payment Gateway` sample application code, hosted on [Github](https://github.com/example/payment-gateway-oauth-samples-node "").

Register Your Application {#register-application_id19818H0H0HT}
===============================================================

Before you can use OAuth credentials to connect to `Payment Gateway`, you must register your application in the `Business Center`. To obtain credentials, contact `Payment Gateway` support:  
[contact-us.html](https://developer.example.com/support/contact-us.md "")

1. Log in to the `Business Center`:
   * Test: [`https://businesscentertest.example.com`](https://businesscentertest.example.com/ebc2/ "")
   * Production: [`https://businesscenter.example.com`](https://businesscenter.example.com/ebc2/ "")
2. Click Account Management in the left-navigation menu and choose Authorized Applications. The OAuth Authorized Applications page appears.{#register-application_step_2}
   {#register-application_step_2}
3. Click Add Application. You must use an administrator account to add or change an application.{#register-application_step_3}
   {#register-application_step_3}
4. Enter this information:
   * Name of the application that you are registering.
   * Description of the application.
   * URL to redirect the merchant to your system after they grant permissions. For more information about the redirect, see [Redirecting the Merchant to `Payment Gateway`](/docs/gateway/en-us/oauth/developer/all/rest/oauth/redirect-merchant-to-pgw.md#redirect-merchant-to-pgw "").
   * Choose permissions for individual APIs or for all listed APIs.
     {#register-application_step_4}
     {#register-application_step_4}
5. Click Save.  
   Your application is registered, and your application's client ID and client secret are shown. You will need them in order to redirect the merchant. Treat the client ID and client secret as confidential information and store them securely. You can regenerate your client secret if you misplace it or if its security is compromised. {#register-application_step_5}

Redirect the Merchant {#redirect-merchant-to-cybs_id1981903J030}
================================================================

Your application must redirect the merchant to `Payment Gateway` so that the merchant can log in with their `Payment Gateway` credentials and provide permissions for your application.
IMPORTANT A merchant giving permissions to your application must log in as an Account Owner or Account Administrator.  
After the merchant provides or denies permissions for your application, `Payment Gateway` redirects the merchant to the redirect URL that you provided when you registered. If the merchant attempted to grant permissions using an account with insufficient privileges, the redirect response is the same as when a merchant denies permission.  
When you redirect the merchant to `Payment Gateway`, encode the URL with the following parameters as a query string:

| Parameter Name | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|:---------------|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sub            | Yes      | Must be set to `oauth`.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| client_id      | Yes      | The client ID that you received when you registered your application in the `Business Center`.                                                                                                                                      |
| redirect_url   | Yes      | The page to which `Payment Gateway` redirects the merchant after the merchant grants your application permissions. The value of the `redirect_url` parameter must exactly match the redirect URL that you supplied during registration. |
| state          | No       | Value that is sent in the response to prevent malicious interception, such as a CSRF attack.                                                                                                                                        |

Interpreting the Redirect Response {#response-parameters_id198190C0FXW}
=======================================================================

After your application redirects the merchant to `Payment Gateway`, this sequence occurs.

1. Merchants not logged in to the `Business Center` at the time of the redirect are prompted to do so. Merchants with expired credentials are prompted to reset them, after which they must click the redirect link again.

2. The `Business Center` page opens, stating the partner's name along with the permissions that the partner is requesting from the merchant. If the merchant logged in using an account with sufficient privileges, the they are prompted to choose Allow or Deny. If the logged-in user does not have sufficient privileges, the Allow button is disabled.

3. If the merchant clicks Deny, `Payment Gateway` redirects the merchant to the URL that you defined in your `redirect_url` parameter with no parameters appended to it. This is not a failure but a denial of permission by the merchant's representative. The denial does not prohibit any future attempt for this or any merchant.

   4. When the merchant clicks Allow, `Payment Gateway` redirects the merchant to the URL that you defined in your `redirect_url` parameter.  
      The redirect URL in the `Payment Gateway` response is encoded with at least one of these parameters:

   | Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
   |:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `code`    | The authorization code that your application sends to `Payment Gateway` when requesting an access token (during the next step of the authentication process). For security reasons, the authorization code expires in ten minutes. If it expires, you must repeat the redirect to request another. |
   | `state`   | This parameter is returned only if it was submitted in the request. It is used to test for possible CSRF attacks. If the state values from the request and response do not match, you could be the victim of a CSRF attack, and you should display an HTTP 401 error code in response.         |

Request the Access and Refresh Tokens {#obtaining-access-refresh-tokens_id198190V0OX4}
======================================================================================

Use the authorization code from the redirect response to request an initial access token, as well as a refresh token, from the `/oauth/v3/token` endpoint. While a header is not required, we recommend including the header `v-c-client-correlation-id` with a unique value for every request to the `/oauth/v3/token` endpoint. For security, all parameters must be sent in the body and use the HTTPS protocol. Do not place any parameters in the URL.

* Test URL: [api-matest.example.com](https://api-matest.example.com "")
* Production URL: [api-ma.example.com](https://api-ma.example.com "")

Refresh the Refresh Token {#refreshing-the-refresh-token}
=========================================================

Access tokens expire after 15 minutes and refresh tokens expire after a year. Merchants are not required to reapprove access after a year; the refresh token's expiration resets to one year after the last successful access token request. You are not required to use an authorization code to make this call.  
Below is an example of a request to obtain a new refresh token. We recommend including the header `v-c-client-correlation-id` with a unique value for every request to the `/token` endpoint.  
Any token request failure results in an HTTP status code of 500 - Server error. Correct any errors and resend.   
We provide a 6-month grace period to request a new refresh token. The new refresh token will expire one year from the last refresh token request. If the merchant has not had any activity within that grace period, they must be prompted to [grant authorization and delegate access](/docs/gateway/en-us/oauth/developer/all/rest/oauth/redirect-merchant-to-pgw.md "").

Revoke Permissions {#revoking-permissions_id1981A080BL7}
========================================================

Merchants can revoke the permissions that they granted to your application. If a merchant revokes your application's permissions in the `Business Center`, any current access token is immediately invalidated, and no new access tokens can be generated. If the merchant decides to grant permissions to your application in the future, they must visit your web-application and begin the permissions process again.

Contact Support {#Contact_id2024I030E5Z}
========================================

If you have questions or are interested in becoming a pilot partner, contact `Payment Gateway` support:  
[contact-us.html](https://developer.example.com/support/contact-us.md "")
